# Connecting Integrations

Integrations let your agents interact with the tools your team already uses. When you connect a service like HubSpot, Gmail, or Slack, your agents gain the ability to look up data, send messages, search files, and perform actions in those systems — all from within a conversation.

## Getting to the Integrations Hub

1. Open the sidebar in your workspace
2. Click **Integrations**
3. You'll see a list of all available integrations along with their connection status

## Available Integrations

## How to Connect an Integration

There are two types of integrations, and each connects a little differently:

### API Key Integrations (HubSpot, Jira, Firecrawl, etc.)

These services use an API key to authenticate:

1. Click on the integration you want to connect
2. Enter your **API key** (you'll find this in the external service's settings — usually under "API" or "Developer" settings)
3. Click **Connect**
4. The status should change to show a green indicator, meaning you're connected

### OAuth Integrations (Gmail, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

These services use a secure sign-in flow:

1. Click on the integration you want to connect
2. Click the **Connect** button
3. A popup window will open asking you to sign in to the service and grant permission
4. Authorize the connection
5. The popup will close automatically, and you'll see a green indicator confirming the connection

That's all there is to it. No passwords are stored — OAuth integrations use secure tokens that can be revoked at any time.

## Checking Connection Status

Each integration shows a status indicator:

- **Green** — Connected and working
- **Red** — There's a problem (expired token, invalid key, or service error)
- **Gray** — Not yet connected

You can check all your connections at a glance from the Integrations Hub.

## Disconnecting an Integration

If you need to remove a connection:

1. Go to the **Integrations Hub**
2. Find the integration you want to disconnect
3. Click on it to open its settings
4. Click **Disconnect**

Disconnecting an integration removes the agent's ability to use that service's tools. Any agents that had those tools attached will no longer be able to access them.

## What Happens When You Connect

When you successfully connect an integration, here's what changes:

1. The integration's **tools become available** in your workspace
2. Any agent that has those tools attached can now use them in conversations
3. You can see which tools came from which integration in the agent's tool settings

For example, connecting HubSpot makes tools like "Search Contacts," "Get Company Details," and "Create Deal" available. You then choose which of these tools to give to specific agents.

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Invalid"

Double-check that you copied the full API key from the external service. Some services have multiple key types — make sure you're using the right one (usually labeled "API Key" or "Access Token").

### "OAuth Token Expired"

OAuth tokens can expire over time. To fix this:

1. Go to the integration's settings
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Click **Connect** again to re-authorize

### "Integration Connected But Tools Not Showing"

After connecting an integration, you still need to attach its tools to specific agents. Go to the agent's settings, open the Tools tab, and enable the tools you want.

### "Connection Keeps Failing"

Check that the external service is operational and that your account has the necessary permissions. Some services require admin-level access to generate API keys.

## For Developers: MCP Access

If you're a developer who wants to connect to AgentC2's tools from your own coding environment (like Cursor or Claude), check out the [MCP Developer Access](/docs/mcp/overview) documentation. This provides a way to use all of AgentC2's capabilities directly from your IDE.
