# Team & Organization

AgentC2 is built for teams. Whether you're a small group getting started with AI agents or a large organization rolling them out across departments, the team management features help you control who has access to what.

## How It's Organized

AgentC2 uses two levels of organization:

### Organizations

An organization is your company's AgentC2 account. It's the top-level container for everything — your agents, integrations, knowledge base, and team members all live within your organization.

Most companies have one organization. When you signed up, you either created one or were invited to join an existing one.

### Workspaces

Within your organization, you can create separate workspaces. Workspaces are independent environments, useful for keeping things organized. For example:

- A **Production** workspace for agents that are live and serving your team or customers
- A **Staging** workspace for testing new agents before they go live
- A **Department** workspace for a specific team that needs its own agents and integrations

Each workspace has its own set of agents, integrations, and settings.

## Inviting Team Members

To invite someone to your organization:

1. Go to **Team** in the sidebar
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email address
4. Choose a role (see below for what each role can do)
5. Click **Send Invite**

They'll receive an email with a link to join. Once they accept, they'll appear in your team list and can start using the workspace based on their assigned role.

## Roles Explained

Every team member has a role that determines what they can do. Here's what each role allows:

### Owner

The owner has full control over the organization. This is typically the person who created the account.

- Everything an Admin can do, plus:
- Manage billing and subscription
- Delete the organization
- Transfer ownership to someone else

There is always exactly one owner per organization.

### Admin

Admins can manage the day-to-day setup of the platform.

- Everything a Member can do, plus:
- Invite and remove team members
- Change member roles
- Manage integrations (connect and disconnect services)
- Configure organization-wide settings

### Member

Members are the standard role for people who actively work with agents.

- Create and configure agents
- Chat with any agent
- Run workflows
- Upload knowledge documents
- View run history
- Use all connected integrations

### Viewer

Viewers have read-only access. This role is ideal for stakeholders who need to see what's happening but don't need to make changes.

- View agents and their configurations
- Read run history and outputs
- Browse knowledge documents
- View team member list

Viewers cannot create agents, start conversations, change settings, or manage integrations.

## Changing a Member's Role

If someone's responsibilities change, you can update their role:

1. Go to **Team** in the sidebar
2. Find the person in the member list
3. Click on their name or the role dropdown
4. Select the new role
5. Confirm the change

Only Owners and Admins can change roles. You cannot change your own role.

## Removing a Member

To remove someone from your organization:

1. Go to **Team** in the sidebar
2. Find the person you want to remove
3. Click the remove option (usually a trash icon or "Remove" button)
4. Confirm the removal

Once removed, that person loses access to all agents, conversations, and data in your organization immediately. Their past conversations and run history remain in the system for your records.

## Transferring Ownership

If you need to make someone else the owner of the organization:

1. Go to **Team** in the sidebar
2. Find the person you want to transfer ownership to (they must already be a member)
3. Click on their profile
4. Select **Transfer Ownership**
5. Confirm the transfer

After transferring, your role will change to Admin. This action cannot be undone without the new owner's cooperation, so make sure you're certain before proceeding.

## Organization Settings

To manage your organization's general settings:

1. Click on your organization name in the top bar, or go to **Settings**
2. Here you can update:
    - **Organization name** — The display name for your company's account
    - **Slug** — The URL-friendly identifier for your organization
    - **Billing** — View your current plan, usage, and payment information

Only Owners can change billing settings. Owners and Admins can update the organization name.
