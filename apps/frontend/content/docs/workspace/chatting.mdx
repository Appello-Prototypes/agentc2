# Chatting with Agents

The chat interface is where you interact with your AI agents. It works like a messaging app — you type a message, the agent responds, and you can go back and forth as many times as you need.

## Starting a Conversation

1. Open the **Chat** section from the sidebar
2. Select an agent from the list — each agent has a name and a brief description of what it does
3. Click on the agent to open a new conversation
4. Type your message in the text box at the bottom and press **Enter** (or click the send button)

That's it. The agent will process your message and reply.

## Understanding Agent Responses

Agents can respond in several ways:

- **Text answers** — Straightforward replies to your questions, just like texting with a colleague
- **Formatted output** — Sometimes agents will present information in tables, bullet points, or structured layouts to make things easier to read
- **Tool activity** — If the agent needs to look something up or take an action (like searching your CRM or checking a calendar), you'll see a brief note in the chat showing what tool it used. This is normal — it means the agent is pulling in real data to give you a better answer.

You don't need to do anything special when the agent uses tools. It happens automatically based on what you asked.

## New Conversations vs. Continuing

- **New conversation** — Click the **New Chat** button (or the "+" icon) to start fresh. The agent won't remember anything from previous conversations.
- **Continue a conversation** — Simply keep typing in the same chat window. The agent remembers everything you've discussed in the current thread and uses that context to give better answers.

Each conversation thread is separate. What you discuss in one thread doesn't carry over to another unless you bring it up.

## Agents Remember Context

Within a conversation, the agent keeps track of what's been said. This means:

- You can refer to things you mentioned earlier ("What about the second option you suggested?")
- You can ask follow-up questions without repeating yourself
- The agent builds on previous responses to give you more relevant answers

This memory lasts for the duration of the conversation thread.

## When Agents Use Tools

Some agents are connected to external tools and services. When you ask a question that requires looking something up, the agent will automatically use the right tool. For example:

- "Find the contact info for Acme Corp" — the agent might search HubSpot
- "What meetings do I have tomorrow?" — the agent might check Google Calendar
- "Summarize the latest sales report" — the agent might search Google Drive

You'll see a small indicator in the chat showing which tool was used and a brief summary of what happened. This transparency helps you understand where the information came from.

## Tips for Better Results

Getting great answers from your agents is partly about how you ask. Here are some practical tips:

- **Be specific** — Instead of "Tell me about our customers," try "How many new customers signed up in January 2026?"
- **Provide context** — If you're working on a particular project, mention it. "For the Q1 marketing campaign, what content ideas would work for our healthcare segment?"
- **Ask follow-up questions** — If the first answer isn't quite right, guide the agent. "That's close, but focus more on email campaigns rather than social media."
- **One thing at a time** — Agents handle focused questions better than multi-part requests. Break big asks into a series of smaller questions.
- **Tell the agent what format you want** — If you need a table, bullet points, or a draft email, just say so. "Give me this as a bullet-point summary."

## Finding Past Conversations

Your conversation history is saved automatically. To find a previous conversation:

1. Open the **Chat** section from the sidebar
2. Look at the conversation list on the left — recent conversations appear at the top
3. Click any past conversation to reopen it and continue where you left off

You can also search through your conversations to find specific topics.

## Rating Responses

If you see a thumbs up or thumbs down option after an agent's response, use it. Your feedback helps improve the agent over time:

- **Thumbs up** — The response was helpful and accurate
- **Thumbs down** — The response missed the mark, was inaccurate, or wasn't useful

This feedback is reviewed by your team's agent administrators to fine-tune how agents behave. The more feedback you provide, the better your agents become.
