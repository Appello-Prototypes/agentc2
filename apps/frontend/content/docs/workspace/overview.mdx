# Welcome to Your Workspace

The AgentC2 workspace is your home base for working with AI agents. It's where you go to have conversations with agents, set them up, connect your favorite tools, and keep track of everything your team is doing with AI.

Think of the workspace as your AI command center — a single place where you and your colleagues can get work done with the help of intelligent agents.

## What Can You Do Here?

The workspace is organized into a few main areas, each accessible from the sidebar on the left:

### Chat

This is where you talk to your agents. Pick an agent, type a message, and get a response. Agents can answer questions, draft content, look up information in your connected tools, and much more. It works just like a messaging app, but the person on the other end is an AI assistant built for your specific needs.

### Agents

Browse all the agents available to your team. You can see what each agent does, try it out, or configure it to work differently. If you have the right permissions, you can create new agents or adjust existing ones — no coding required.

### Integrations

Connect the external tools your team already uses. When you link services like HubSpot, Slack, Gmail, Google Drive, or Jira, your agents gain the ability to look up contacts, send messages, search files, and more — all from within a conversation.

### Runs

Every time an agent does something, it creates a record called a "run." The Runs area lets you see what your agents have been up to, review their outputs, and understand how they arrived at their answers. This is especially helpful for quality checks and troubleshooting.

### Team

Invite colleagues to your workspace, assign roles, and manage who has access to what. Whether you need someone to just view agent outputs or fully manage your AI setup, the team area has you covered.

### Knowledge

Upload documents, guides, and reference materials that your agents can search through when answering questions. This is how you give your agents the specific knowledge they need about your business.

## Getting Started

### Finding Your Way Around

When you first open the workspace, here's what you'll see:

- **Sidebar (left side)** — Your navigation hub. Click any section to jump to it. You'll find Chat, Agents, Integrations, Knowledge, Runs, and Team listed here.
- **Main area (center)** — This is where the content lives. When you select an agent to chat with, the conversation appears here. When you browse agents, they're listed here.
- **Top bar** — Shows your current location in the workspace and provides quick access to your account settings and organization switcher.

The workspace is designed to be intuitive. If you can use email or a messaging app, you can use AgentC2. Start by heading to the Chat section, pick an agent, and say hello.
