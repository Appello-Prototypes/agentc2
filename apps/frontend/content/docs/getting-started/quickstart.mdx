# Quickstart

Create your first agent and have a conversation with it in under 5 minutes. No code required.

## Step 1: Sign up

Go to [agentc2.ai/signup](/signup) and create your account. You'll land in your workspace -- your home base for everything in AgentC2.

## Step 2: Create an agent

1. Click **Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Agent**
3. Fill in the basics:
    - **Name**: Give it a name like "My First Agent"
    - **Instructions**: Describe what it should do, e.g. "You are a helpful assistant. Answer questions clearly and concisely."
    - **Model**: Choose a model (GPT-4o is a good default)
4. Click **Create**

    Start with simple instructions. You can always refine them after testing.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Chat with your agent

Click into the agent and start typing. Your agent will respond based on the instructions you gave it.

Try asking:

- "What can you help me with?"
- "Summarize the key trends in AI for 2026"
- "Draft an email to a client about our new product launch"

## Step 4: Review the run

Every conversation generates a **run** -- a detailed record of what the agent did.

1. Go to **Runs** in the sidebar
2. Click on a recent run to see the trace

Each run shows:

- What the agent was asked
- What tools it used (if any)
- How long it took
- How much it cost

## Step 5: Add tools

Agents become powerful when they can interact with external services. To add tools:

1. Open your agent's settings
2. Go to the **Tools** section
3. Select tools from your connected integrations (e.g., web search, CRM lookup)
4. Save

Now your agent can take real actions -- fetching web pages, looking up contacts, searching documents.

    You'll need to connect at least one integration first. See **[Connect Your First
    Integration](/docs/getting-started/connect-integration)** for a step-by-step walkthrough.
