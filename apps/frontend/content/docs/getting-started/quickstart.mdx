# Quickstart

This guide walks you through creating an agent, sending it a message, and inspecting the run trace. You'll have a working agent in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- An AgentC2 account ([sign up here](/signup))
- An OpenAI or Anthropic API key configured in your workspace settings

## Step 1: Create an agent

Send a POST request to create a new agent:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My First Agent",
    "instructions": "You are a helpful assistant. Answer questions clearly and concisely.",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "memoryEnabled": true
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "id": "cm...",
    "slug": "my-first-agent",
    "name": "My First Agent",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "memoryEnabled": true,
    "isActive": true,
    "createdAt": "2026-02-18T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

You can also create agents through the workspace UI at **Agents > New Agent**. The UI provides a form with all configuration options and real-time validation.

## Step 2: Send a message

Use the chat endpoint to send a message and get a streamed response:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/my-first-agent/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "What are the three laws of thermodynamics?" }
    ]
  }'
```

The response streams back as server-sent events. Each chunk contains a text delta that you can render in real time.

## Step 3: Inspect the run

Every agent execution creates a run record with full tracing. List recent runs:

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/my-first-agent/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Each run includes:

| Field                          | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                           | Unique run identifier                        |
| `status`                       | `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, or `RUNNING`          |
| `inputTokens` / `outputTokens` | Token usage for cost tracking                |
| `costUsd`                      | Estimated cost of the run                    |
| `durationMs`                   | Total execution time                         |
| `traces`                       | Step-by-step execution trace with tool calls |

## Step 4: Add tools

Agents become powerful when they can use tools. Attach an MCP tool to give your agent access to external services:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/my-first-agent/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "toolId": "web-fetch"
  }'
```

Now your agent can fetch web pages to answer questions with real-time information.
