# Key Concepts

AgentC2 is organized around six core primitives. Each serves a distinct purpose, and understanding when to use each is the key to building effective AI systems.

## Agents

An **Agent** is an autonomous executor that uses an LLM and tools to solve open-ended tasks. Agents reason about goals, decide which tools to call, and iterate until they produce a final answer.

Every agent has:

- **Instructions** -- A system prompt that defines behavior and personality
- **Model** -- The LLM provider and model (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- **Tools** -- External capabilities the agent can invoke (web fetch, CRM lookup, email send)
- **Memory** -- Conversation history and semantic recall across interactions
- **Guardrails** -- Input/output policy layers that prevent unsafe behavior

Use agents when the task is open-ended and requires reasoning. For deterministic multi-step processes, use workflows instead.

```json
{
    "name": "Support Agent",
    "instructions": "You are a customer support specialist...",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "memoryEnabled": true,
    "tools": ["web-fetch", "hubspot-search-contacts"]
}
```

## Skills

A **Skill** is a reusable capability bundle -- instructions, tools, and documents packaged together so they can be attached to any agent without duplicating configuration.

Skills solve the problem of shared behavior. If three agents need the same "email drafting" capability, you create one skill and attach it to all three. When you update the skill, all agents inherit the change.

Skills support versioning and progressive disclosure: they can be pinned (always loaded) or discoverable (loaded only when the context requires them).

## Workflows

A **Workflow** defines a deterministic multi-step process with explicit control flow. Unlike agents, workflows don't rely on LLM reasoning for sequencing -- you define the exact order of operations.

Key features:

- **Steps** with typed input/output schemas
- **Branching** for conditional paths
- **Parallel execution** for independent steps
- **Human-in-the-loop** approval gates
- **Retry** logic for transient failures

Use workflows when you need guarantees about execution order, when compliance requires explicit approval gates, or when the process is well-defined and doesn't need creative reasoning.

```
Input → Step 1 (Classify) → Branch:
  ├─ High Priority → Step 2a (Escalate)
  └─ Normal → Step 2b (Auto-respond) → Step 3 (Log)
```

## Networks

A **Network** orchestrates multiple agents via topology-aware routing. Each agent in the network specializes in a narrow domain, and the network coordinator routes tasks to the best-fit agent.

Network topologies include:

- **Router** -- A coordinator agent examines the input and delegates to specialists
- **Sequential** -- Agents process in order, each refining the previous output
- **Parallel** -- Multiple agents work simultaneously, results are merged

Use networks when a single agent would need too many tools or too broad an instruction set. Decomposing into specialists improves accuracy and reduces cost.

## Campaigns

A **Campaign** models mission-style operations where a high-level goal is decomposed into tasks across agents and workflows. Campaigns are suited for multi-stage business processes that need measurable progress and structured after-action reviews.

Each campaign has:

- **Intent** -- What you want to accomplish
- **End state** -- How you'll know it's done
- **Missions** -- Individual tasks assigned to agents
- **After-action review** -- Automated analysis of what worked and what didn't

## Integrations

**Integrations** connect AgentC2 to external services. There are two types:

- **MCP integrations** -- Connect via Model Context Protocol servers (HubSpot, Jira, GitHub, Firecrawl, etc.). MCP provides a standard tool interface that any agent can use.
- **OAuth integrations** -- Direct API connections with token management (Gmail, Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Dropbox). Tokens are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.

## How they fit together

A typical production setup combines these primitives:

1. **Integrations** connect to your CRM, email, and project management tools
2. **Skills** package reusable capabilities (email drafting, data lookup, report generation)
3. **Agents** use skills and integration tools to handle individual tasks
4. **Workflows** enforce explicit processes (approval chains, data pipelines)
5. **Networks** coordinate multiple agents for complex, multi-domain tasks
6. **Campaigns** orchestrate long-running missions with progress tracking

The key design principle: each primitive handles one level of complexity. Don't use agents for deterministic sequencing (use workflows). Don't use a single agent for multi-domain tasks (use networks). Choose the right primitive for the right job.
