# About AgentC2

AgentC2 is a platform for building, deploying, and operating AI agents that connect to your tools and work across every channel. It gives you everything you need to go from a prototype to a production agent: model routing, memory, guardrails, cost controls, versioning, and observability.

## Why AgentC2?

Most AI agent frameworks help you get a demo working. AgentC2 is designed for what comes after:

- **Production reliability** -- Guardrails, budget limits, and input/output policy layers prevent agents from going off-script. Every run is traced and scored.
- **Database-driven agents** -- Agent definitions, versions, tools, and metrics live in PostgreSQL, not in code files. You can audit, compare, and roll back any change.
- **40+ integrations** -- Connect agents to HubSpot, Jira, Slack, GitHub, Gmail, Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Dropbox, and more via MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and native OAuth.
- **Multi-agent orchestration** -- Build networks of specialized agents that delegate tasks, verify each other's work, and converge on a final answer.
- **Every channel** -- Deploy the same agent logic across Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, voice (ElevenLabs), and web embed widgets.

## What can you build?

- **Customer support agents** that triage tickets, route to specialists, and auto-respond to known issues
- **Research agents** that scrape the web, ingest documents, and synthesize findings with RAG
- **Sales agents** that qualify leads in your CRM, draft follow-up emails, and schedule meetings
- **Multi-agent networks** where a coordinator delegates tasks to specialized agents for analysis, writing, and review
- **Voice agents** that handle phone calls with real-time speech synthesis and tool execution

## Core primitives

AgentC2 is organized around six primitives. Each is a first-class, versioned entity in your database:

| Primitive       | Purpose                                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**       | Autonomous executor with instructions, model routing, tools, memory, and guardrails |
| **Skill**       | Reusable capability bundle that can be attached to any agent                        |
| **Workflow**    | Deterministic multi-step process with branching, approvals, and retries             |
| **Network**     | Multi-agent topology that routes tasks to the best-fit agent                        |
| **Campaign**    | Mission-style operation that decomposes a goal into tasks across agents             |
| **Integration** | External service connection via MCP or OAuth (CRM, email, project management)       |

## Technology stack

AgentC2 is built on Mastra, the open-source TypeScript AI agent framework, extended with enterprise features:

| Layer    | Technology                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Runtime  | Bun, Next.js 16, TypeScript 5                    |
| AI       | Mastra Core, AI SDK, OpenAI, Anthropic           |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Supabase), Prisma 6                  |
| Auth     | Better Auth with session-based cross-app cookies |
| UI       | shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4                        |
| Voice    | ElevenLabs, OpenAI Realtime                      |
| Jobs     | Inngest for background event processing          |
