# What is AgentC2?

AgentC2 is a platform for building, deploying, and operating AI agents that connect to your tools and work across every channel. No coding required.

You configure agents through a workspace UI, connect the services your team already uses, and deploy across Slack, WhatsApp, voice, and web. Everything is versioned, traced, and cost-controlled.

## What can you build?

- **Customer support agents** that triage tickets, route to specialists, and auto-respond to known issues
- **Sales agents** that qualify leads in your CRM, draft follow-up emails, and schedule meetings
- **Research agents** that scrape the web, ingest documents, and synthesize findings
- **Multi-agent networks** where specialists collaborate -- one researches, another analyzes, a third writes the report
- **Voice agents** that handle phone calls with real-time speech synthesis and tool execution

## Why AgentC2?

Most AI tools help you get a demo working. AgentC2 is designed for what comes after:

- **15+ integrations** -- Connect to HubSpot, Jira, Slack, GitHub, Gmail, Google Drive, Outlook, Dropbox, and more
- **Multi-agent networks** -- Build teams of specialized agents that coordinate through intelligent routing
- **Every channel** -- Deploy the same agent across Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, voice, and web embed
- **Production controls** -- Guardrails, budget limits, versioning, and full tracing for every run
- **No code required** -- Configure everything through the workspace UI

## How it's organized

AgentC2 has five core building blocks:

| Building block  | What it does                                                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**       | An AI assistant with instructions, tools, memory, and guardrails     |
| **Integration** | A connection to an external service (CRM, email, project management) |
| **Network**     | Multiple agents working together with intelligent routing            |
| **Workflow**    | A deterministic multi-step process with branching and approvals      |
| **Knowledge**   | Documents and data your agents can search and reference              |
