# Skills Overview

Skills are reusable capability bundles that combine instructions, tools, and documents to enable shared behavior across multiple agents. They encapsulate procedural knowledge, tool configurations, and reference materials into composable units that agents can inherit, reducing duplication and ensuring consistent behavior.

## What are skills?

A skill is a database-driven primitive that packages three types of knowledge:

- **Instructions** — Procedural knowledge describing how to perform a task (e.g., "When drafting emails, use a professional tone, include a clear subject line, and end with a call-to-action")
- **Tools** — External capabilities the skill requires (e.g., `send-email`, `search-contacts`, `format-calendar-event`)
- **Documents** — Reference materials, examples, or context documents that inform the skill's behavior

Skills are stored in PostgreSQL and attached to agents via the `AgentSkill` junction table. When an agent resolves, it loads all attached skills and merges their instructions, tools, and documents into its runtime configuration.

    **Skills vs Agents**: Skills define *what* an agent can do (capabilities), while agents define
    *who* the agent is (identity, model, behavior). Multiple agents can share the same skill,
    ensuring consistent capability implementation across your platform.
</Callout>

## When to use skills

Use skills when you need:

- **Shared behavior across agents** — Multiple agents need the same capability (e.g., email drafting, calendar management, CRM updates)
- **Consistent tool usage** — Standardize how tools are used across agents (e.g., all support agents use the same ticket creation pattern)
- **Knowledge reuse** — Reference documents, examples, or procedures that multiple agents need access to
- **Version control** — Track changes to capabilities independently from agent configurations
- **Progressive disclosure** — Load capabilities on-demand based on conversation context (see [Progressive Disclosure](/docs/skills/progressive-disclosure))

### Example use cases

| Use Case                | Skill Name       | Instructions                                           | Tools                                           | Documents                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Email Drafting**      | `email-drafting` | "Draft professional emails with clear structure..."    | `send-email`, `search-contacts`                 | Email templates, style guide       |
| **Calendar Management** | `calendar-ops`   | "Schedule meetings respecting availability..."         | `create-event`, `check-availability`            | Meeting templates, timezone guide  |
| **CRM Updates**         | `crm-sync`       | "Update HubSpot records with consistent formatting..." | `hubspot-update-contact`, `hubspot-create-deal` | CRM field mapping, data standards  |
| **Code Review**         | `code-review`    | "Review code for security, performance, and style..."  | `read-file`, `run-tests`                        | Code standards, security checklist |

## Skill lifecycle

Every skill follows a predictable lifecycle from creation to production use:

### 1. Create

Define the skill's core knowledge:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "slug": "email-drafting",
    "name": "Email Drafting",
    "description": "Draft professional emails with proper formatting and tone",
    "instructions": "When drafting emails:\n1. Use a clear, professional subject line\n2. Start with a greeting\n3. Structure content with paragraphs\n4. Include a call-to-action\n5. End with a professional closing",
    "examples": "Subject: Meeting Request\n\nHi [Name],\n\nI would like to schedule a meeting to discuss...\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
    "category": "communication",
    "tags": ["email", "drafting", "professional"]
  }'
```

### 2. Attach resources

Add tools and documents:

```bash
# Attach a tool
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/skills/email-drafting/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "toolId": "send-email" }'

# Attach a document
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/skills/email-drafting/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "documentId": "doc_email_templates" }'
```

### 3. Attach to agents

Make the skill available to agents:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/support-agent/skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "skillId": "email-drafting",
    "pinned": true
  }'
```

### 4. Version

Create snapshots before making changes:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/skills/email-drafting/versions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "changeSummary": "Added email template examples"
  }'
```

### 5. Use

Agents automatically inherit skills when resolving. The agent resolver merges skill instructions, tools, and documents into the agent's runtime configuration.

## Skill model fields

The `Skill` model in PostgreSQL contains these fields:

| Field          | Type     | Required | Description                                                             |

### Relations

Skills have several relations:

- **`documents`** — `SkillDocument[]` — Reference documents attached to the skill
- **`tools`** — `SkillTool[]` — Tools required by the skill
- **`agents`** — `AgentSkill[]` — Agents that have this skill attached
- **`versions`** — `SkillVersion[]` — Version history snapshots

## Skill types

Skills can be one of two types:

- **USER** — Created by users, stored in your workspace, fully customizable
- **SYSTEM** — Platform-provided skills (e.g., auto-generated from integrations), protected from deletion

Most skills you create are **USER** type. They're isolated to your workspace and organization, ensuring data privacy and multi-tenant security.

## Auto-generated skills

When you provision integrations (HubSpot, Slack, GitHub, etc.), the platform automatically generates skills that encapsulate integration-specific knowledge. These skills:

- Are marked as `type: "SYSTEM"`
- Include integration-specific instructions (e.g., "How to use HubSpot API")
- Attach relevant MCP tools (e.g., `hubspot-get-contact`)
- Can be attached to any agent

See [Auto-Generated Skills](/docs/skills/auto-generated-skills) for details.

## Progressive disclosure

Skills support two attachment modes:

- **Pinned** (`pinned: true`) — Always loaded when the agent resolves (default)
- **Discoverable** (`pinned: false`) — Loaded on-demand when context requires them

Discoverable skills reduce context window overhead by only loading capabilities when needed. The agent resolver uses meta-tools to discover and activate relevant skills during conversation.

See [Progressive Disclosure](/docs/skills/progressive-disclosure) for details.
