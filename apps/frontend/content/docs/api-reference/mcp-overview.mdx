# MCP Developer Access

AgentC2 exposes a full-featured MCP server that lets you manage your entire AI agent platform from any MCP-compatible client. Instead of switching between the web UI and your development environment, you can create agents, run workflows, ingest documents, and monitor costs directly from Cursor, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Claude CoWork, or any tool that speaks the Model Context Protocol.

## What the MCP server provides

The AgentC2 MCP server exposes **202 tools** organized across seven categories. Every operation you can perform in the AgentC2 workspace UI is available as an MCP tool, giving your AI assistant full access to the platform.

### Tool categories

| Category                    | Tools | What you can do                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Management**        | ~50   | Create, configure, invoke, budget, evaluate, and learn from agents    |
| **Workflow Management**     | ~15   | Design, validate, execute, and monitor multi-step workflows           |
| **Network Management**      | ~10   | Build and execute multi-agent networks with topology routing          |
| **Knowledge / RAG**         | ~5    | Ingest documents, query the knowledge base, manage document lifecycle |
| **Skill Management**        | ~10   | Create reusable capability bundles, attach tools and documents        |
| **Integration Management**  | ~10   | Connect external services, list MCP tools, check health               |
| **Organization Management** | ~5    | Manage workspaces and team members                                    |

Additional utility tools like `read_workspace_file`, `write_workspace_file`, `verify_branch`, `wait_for_checks`, and `track_resource` round out the developer experience.

## Supported clients

| Client             | Transport                                  | Status                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Cursor IDE**     | stdio proxy (Node.js script → AgentC2 API) | Supported              |
| **Claude CoWork**  | Remote Streamable HTTP                     | Supported              |
| **Claude Desktop** | Remote Streamable HTTP                     | Supported              |
| **Claude Code**    | Remote Streamable HTTP                     | Supported              |
| **ChatGPT**        | Remote Streamable HTTP                     | When MCP support ships |
| **Any MCP client** | Streamable HTTP (MCP spec 2025-03-26)      | Supported              |

## How it works

The MCP server is organization-scoped. Each organization gets its own endpoint:

```
https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/server/{orgSlug}
```

The server uses **Streamable HTTP** transport (MCP specification 2025-03-26) with **OAuth 2.1** authentication. Your organization slug acts as the `client_id`, and your MCP API key acts as the `client_secret`. The OAuth flow auto-approves so there is no manual consent step — connect and start using tools immediately.

### Authentication flow

1. Your MCP client connects to the server endpoint
2. The server challenges with OAuth 2.1
3. Your client authenticates with `client_id` (org slug) and `client_secret` (API key)
4. A bearer token is issued
5. All subsequent tool calls use the bearer token

### Organization scoping

Every tool call is scoped to your organization. When you call `agent_create`, the agent is created in your workspace. When you call `rag_query`, it searches your organization's knowledge base. There is no cross-organization access.

<Callout type="info">
    The MCP server uses the same permissions model as the AgentC2 workspace. Any action you can
    perform in the UI, you can perform via MCP tools. Organization-level policies and guardrails
    apply equally.
