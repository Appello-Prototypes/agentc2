# Agents Overview

Agents are autonomous AI systems that use large language models (LLMs) to understand user requests, make decisions, execute tools, and maintain conversation context. They combine LLM reasoning with external tools, persistent memory, and safety guardrails to deliver production-ready AI applications.

## What are agents?

An agent in AgentC2 is a database-driven AI system that:

- **Processes natural language** using OpenAI or Anthropic models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, etc.)
- **Executes tools** to interact with external systems (web search, CRM, databases, APIs)
- **Maintains memory** across conversations using message history and semantic recall
- **Operates within guardrails** defined by input/output policies and cost budgets
- **Produces traced runs** with full observability for debugging and compliance

Agents are stored in PostgreSQL and resolved at runtime, enabling version control, A/B testing, and dynamic configuration updates without code deployments.

## When to use agents

Agents excel at tasks that require:

- **Conversational interfaces** — Chatbots, support assistants, voice agents
- **Multi-step reasoning** — Research, analysis, planning that requires multiple tool calls
- **Context awareness** — Applications that need to remember past interactions
- **Dynamic behavior** — Scenarios where the agent decides which tools to use based on the request

<Callout type="info">
    **Agents vs Workflows vs Networks**: Use **agents** for conversational, LLM-driven tasks. Use
    **workflows** for deterministic, step-by-step processes. Use **networks** to orchestrate
    multiple agents and workflows together.
</Callout>

## Agent lifecycle

Every agent follows a predictable lifecycle from creation to production monitoring:

### 1. Create

Define your agent's identity, instructions, and model configuration:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Research Assistant",
    "slug": "research-assistant",
    "instructions": "You are a research assistant. Search the web for current information and synthesize clear, well-sourced answers.",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.3
  }'
```

### 2. Configure

Attach tools, enable memory, set guardrails, and configure advanced options:

```bash
# Attach a web search tool
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "toolId": "web-fetch" }'

# Enable memory with semantic recall
curl -X PATCH https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "memoryEnabled": true,
    "memoryConfig": {
      "lastMessages": 20,
      "semanticRecall": { "topK": 3 }
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Test

Send messages and verify behavior in the workspace UI or via API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "What are the latest developments in AI agent frameworks?" }
    ]
  }'
```

### 4. Version

Create snapshots before making changes:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/versions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "changeNotes": "Initial production configuration with web-fetch tool"
  }'
```

### 5. Deploy

Activate the agent for production use. Agents are automatically available via:

- **Chat API** — `/agent/api/agents/{slug}/chat`
- **Public embeds** — Generate a public token for unauthenticated access
- **Webhooks** — Configure triggers for event-driven execution
- **Schedules** — Set up cron-based recurring runs
- **Integrations** — Connect to Slack, WhatsApp, voice platforms

### 6. Monitor

Track performance, costs, and quality:

```bash
# List recent runs
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/runs?limit=10 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# View evaluation scores
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/evaluations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Hello world example

Create a minimal agent and chat with it:

```bash
# Step 1: Create the agent
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Hello World Agent",
    "instructions": "You are a friendly assistant. Greet users warmly and answer questions helpfully.",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "temperature": 0.7
  }'

# Response includes the agent slug (auto-generated from name)
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "agent": {
#     "id": "cm...",
#     "slug": "hello-world-agent",
#     ...
#   }
# }

# Step 2: Chat with the agent
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/hello-world-agent/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello! What can you do?" }
    ]
  }'
```

The chat endpoint streams the response as server-sent events, allowing you to render text incrementally as it's generated.

<Callout type="tip">
    All agent capabilities are configured via the API or workspace UI. No code deployments required
    — changes take effect immediately for all production channels (API, Slack, voice, webhooks).

## Agent types

Agents can be one of three types:

- **USER** — Created by users, stored in your workspace, fully customizable
- **SYSTEM** — Platform-provided agents (e.g., `assistant`) with default configurations
- **SKILL** — Agents bundled with skills, automatically available when skills are attached

Most agents you create are **USER** type. They're isolated to your workspace and organization, ensuring data privacy and multi-tenant security.
