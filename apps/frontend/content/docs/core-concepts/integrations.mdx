# Integrations

Integrations connect your agents to the tools your team already uses. When you connect a service like HubSpot, Slack, or Gmail, your agents gain the ability to look up contacts, send messages, search files, and more -- all from within a conversation.

## Available integrations

AgentC2 connects to 15+ services across CRM, communication, productivity, and web tools.

## Connecting an integration

1. Go to **Integrations** in the workspace sidebar
2. Find the service you want to connect
3. Click **Connect** and follow the setup flow (API key or OAuth sign-in)
4. Once connected, the integration's tools are available to all your agents

## How integrations work

AgentC2 uses two approaches to connect with external services:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** -- A standardized protocol for tool discovery and execution. Most integrations use MCP, which means agents can dynamically discover what actions are available.
- **OAuth** -- Direct API connections with automatic token refresh for services like Gmail, Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, and Dropbox.

Once connected, you attach integration tools to specific agents. An agent only has access to the tools you explicitly give it.
