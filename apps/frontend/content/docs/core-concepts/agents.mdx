# Agents

An agent is an AI assistant that can reason about tasks, use tools, remember conversations, and take actions on your behalf. You configure an agent by giving it instructions, choosing a model, and attaching the tools it needs.

## How agents work

When you send a message to an agent, it:

1. **Reads your message** and decides what to do
2. **Calls tools** if it needs external information (search the web, look up a contact, check a calendar)
3. **Remembers context** from earlier in the conversation
4. **Responds** with an answer, a summary, or a completed action

All of this is tracked automatically. Every agent run records what happened, what tools were called, how long it took, and how much it cost.

## Creating an agent

You can create an agent directly from the workspace UI -- no code required.

1. Go to **Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Agent**
3. Give it a name and write instructions that describe its role
4. Choose a model (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, etc.)
5. Attach tools from your connected integrations
6. Start chatting

## Key capabilities

| Capability      | What it does                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tools**       | Call external services -- search your CRM, send emails, fetch web pages |
| **Memory**      | Remember past conversations and recall relevant context                 |
| **Guardrails**  | Enforce rules about what the agent can and cannot do                    |
| **Versioning**  | Snapshot configurations so you can roll back safely                     |
| **Budgets**     | Set monthly spend limits to control costs                               |
| **Evaluations** | Automatically score response quality                                    |
| **Tracing**     | See exactly what happened in every run, step by step                    |

## Skills: reusable capability bundles

Skills let you package instructions, tools, and reference documents into a reusable bundle that any agent can inherit. Instead of duplicating the same email-drafting instructions across three agents, create one "Email Drafting" skill and attach it to all of them.

When you update a skill, every agent using it gets the update automatically.

## When to use agents vs. other primitives

| Use case                              | Best primitive |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Open-ended conversation and reasoning | **Agent**      |
| Multi-step process with fixed steps   | **Workflow**   |
| Task that needs multiple specialists  | **Network**    |
| Complex goal with phases and reviews  | **Campaign**   |
