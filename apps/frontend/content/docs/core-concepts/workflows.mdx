# Workflows

Workflows define multi-step processes with explicit control flow. Unlike agents, which use AI reasoning to decide what to do next, workflows follow a predetermined sequence of steps. You define the exact order of operations, including branches, loops, and approval gates.

## When to use workflows

Use workflows when you need:

- **Guaranteed execution order** -- Steps must happen in a specific sequence
- **Human approval gates** -- A person must review and approve before proceeding
- **Retry logic** -- Automatically retry failed steps
- **Compliance requirements** -- You need an auditable record of exactly what happened and when

## How workflows work

A workflow is a series of connected steps. Each step has typed inputs and outputs, so data flows predictably through the process.

```
Input -> Classify -> Branch:
  |-- High Priority -> Escalate -> Notify Manager
  |-- Normal -> Auto-Respond -> Log
```

### Step types

| Step              | What it does                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent step**    | Calls an agent to reason about the input and produce output   |
| **Tool step**     | Executes a specific tool (send email, update CRM, fetch data) |
| **Branch step**   | Routes to different paths based on conditions                 |
| **Loop step**     | Repeats steps until a condition is met                        |
| **Approval step** | Pauses and waits for human review                             |
| **Parallel step** | Runs multiple steps simultaneously                            |

## Creating a workflow

1. Go to **Workflows** in the workspace sidebar
2. Click **New Workflow**
3. Use the visual editor to add and connect steps
4. Configure each step's inputs, outputs, and conditions
5. Test with sample data

You can also use the **AI-assisted designer** -- describe the process in plain language, and AgentC2 will generate a workflow definition for you to review and refine.

## Agents vs. workflows

| Agents                                  | Workflows                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Decide what to do based on AI reasoning | Follow a fixed sequence of steps            |
| Handle open-ended, creative tasks       | Handle structured, repeatable processes     |
| May call different tools each time      | Always execute the same steps               |
| Best for conversation and analysis      | Best for data pipelines and approval chains |

You can combine both: use a workflow that includes agent steps for the parts that need reasoning, while keeping the overall process deterministic.
