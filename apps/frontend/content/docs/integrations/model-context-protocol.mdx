# Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how AI applications discover and use external tools. AgentC2 uses MCP as its primary integration layer, connecting agents to 15+ external services through a unified tool interface.

## How MCP works

MCP uses a host-client-server architecture:

- **Host** -- The application that runs AI agents (AgentC2)
- **Client** -- The protocol client that manages connections to MCP servers
- **Server** -- An external service that exposes tools via the MCP protocol

When an agent needs to use a tool, the flow is:

1. Agent decides to call a tool (e.g., `hubspot-search-contacts`)
2. AgentC2's MCP client routes the call to the correct MCP server
3. The MCP server executes the operation against the external API
4. Results are returned to the agent for processing

## Tool discovery

List all available MCP tools across all connected servers:

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Each tool has a name, description, and input schema (JSON Schema) that the agent uses to construct valid calls.

## Tool execution

Execute a specific MCP tool:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/tools/hubspot-search-contacts/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "john@example.com"
  }'
```

## Tool naming conventions

MCP tools follow the pattern `{server}-{tool-name}`:

| Server    | Example Tools                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| hubspot   | `hubspot-search-contacts`, `hubspot-create-deal` |
| jira      | `jira-search-issues`, `jira-create-issue`        |
| github    | `github-search-repos`, `github-create-issue`     |
| firecrawl | `firecrawl-scrape-url`, `firecrawl-crawl-site`   |

## AgentC2's MCP extensions

AgentC2 extends the base MCP protocol with enterprise controls:

### Credential isolation

Each MCP server connection uses org-scoped credentials. API keys are stored in environment variables and never exposed to agents or end users.

### Policy controls

Organization-level policies can restrict which MCP tools are available to which agents. This prevents agents from accessing tools they shouldn't use.

### Tool health monitoring

AgentC2 tracks tool execution success rates, latency, and error patterns. If a tool's failure rate exceeds thresholds, it can be automatically disabled.

## Configured MCP servers

AgentC2 includes pre-configured MCP servers for:

| Server       | Category      | Purpose                               |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| HubSpot      | CRM           | Contacts, companies, deals, pipelines |
| Jira         | Productivity  | Issues, sprints, project tracking     |
| Slack        | Communication | Channels, messages, users, search     |
| GitHub       | Development   | Repos, issues, PRs, code, actions     |
| Google Drive | Productivity  | File search, list, read               |
| Firecrawl    | Web           | Web scraping, content extraction      |
| Fathom       | Knowledge     | Meeting recordings, transcripts       |
| JustCall     | Communication | Call logs, SMS messaging              |

## Adding custom MCP servers

You can connect additional MCP servers to extend AgentC2's capabilities. See [Building Custom Integrations](/docs/integrations/building-custom) for a step-by-step guide.
