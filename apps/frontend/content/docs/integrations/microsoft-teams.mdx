# Microsoft Teams

The Microsoft Teams integration allows AgentC2 agents to interact with Teams channels and chats, enabling automated messaging, notifications, and conversational AI within your organization's Teams workspace.

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft 365 tenant with Teams enabled
- An Azure AD app registration with Teams permissions
- Microsoft Graph API credentials (same as Outlook integration)

## Setup

1. Use the same Azure AD app registration from your [Microsoft Outlook](/docs/integrations/microsoft-outlook) setup, or create a new one in the Azure Portal

2. Add Teams-specific API permissions:
    - `ChannelMessage.Send` -- Post messages to channels
    - `Chat.ReadWrite` -- Read and send chat messages
    - `Team.ReadBasic.All` -- List teams and channels

3. Configure environment variables:

```bash
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID="your-azure-app-client-id"
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET="your-azure-app-client-secret"
MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
```

4. Verify the connection:

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/integrations/providers/microsoft-teams/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Environment variables

| Variable                  | Required | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`     | Yes      | Azure AD application client ID                     |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes      | Azure AD application client secret                 |
| `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`     | Yes      | Azure AD tenant ID (use "common" for multi-tenant) |

## Available capabilities

| Capability           | Description                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Send channel message | Post messages to Teams channels      |
| Send chat message    | Send direct or group chat messages   |
| List teams           | List teams the app has access to     |
| List channels        | List channels within a team          |
| Create adaptive card | Send rich, interactive card messages |

## Common patterns

### Post agent summaries to a channel

After an agent completes a task, post a summary to a Teams channel:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/report-agent/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Generate a daily sales summary and post it to the #sales-updates Teams channel"
    }]
  }'
```

### Interactive approvals via adaptive cards

Use adaptive cards to create approval buttons that users can click directly in Teams, triggering workflow steps in AgentC2.

<Callout type="info">
    Microsoft Teams and Slack serve similar roles. If your organization uses both, consider
    standardizing on one channel to simplify agent configuration and reduce maintenance overhead.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                | Solution                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication failed  | Verify client ID, secret, and tenant ID are correct                              |
| Permission denied      | Ensure the Azure AD app has the required Graph API permissions and admin consent |
| Messages not appearing | Check the app is installed in the target team and has channel access             |
| Rate limited           | Microsoft Graph has throttling limits; implement retry with exponential backoff  |
