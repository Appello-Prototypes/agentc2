# Jira

The Jira integration connects AgentC2 to Atlassian Jira via an MCP server, giving agents the ability to search issues, create tickets, manage sprints, and track project progress.

## Prerequisites

- A Jira Cloud instance (e.g., `your-org.atlassian.net`)
- A Jira API token ([generate one here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens))
- The email address associated with your Atlassian account

## Setup

1. Generate an API token from your Atlassian account settings
2. Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
JIRA_URL="https://your-org.atlassian.net"
JIRA_USERNAME="your-email@example.com"
JIRA_API_TOKEN="ATATT3x..."
JIRA_PROJECTS_FILTER="PROJECT_KEY"
```

3. Restart the agent app to load the new configuration
4. Verify the connection by listing available tools:

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/tools?server=jira \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `JIRA_URL` | Yes | Your Jira Cloud instance URL |
| `JIRA_USERNAME` | Yes | Email address for authentication |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | Yes | API token for authentication |
| `JIRA_PROJECTS_FILTER` | No | Comma-separated project keys to limit scope |

## Available tools

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `jira-search-issues` | Search issues using JQL queries |
| `jira-get-issue` | Get issue details by key |
| `jira-create-issue` | Create a new issue |
| `jira-update-issue` | Update issue fields |
| `jira-transition-issue` | Move issue to a new status |
| `jira-add-comment` | Add a comment to an issue |
| `jira-list-projects` | List accessible projects |
| `jira-get-sprint` | Get sprint details |

## Common patterns

### Triage incoming support tickets

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/support-agent/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Search for all unresolved bugs in the SUPPORT project with priority High or Critical"
    }]
  }'
```

### Auto-create issues from conversations

An agent can create Jira issues based on chat conversations:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/support-agent/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Create a bug ticket in SUPPORT for: Login page returns 500 error when using SSO. Priority: High."
    }]
  }'
```

<Callout type="warning">
Agents with Jira write access (create, update, transition) should have guardrails to prevent unintended ticket modifications. Consider using approval gates for issue creation in production.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Authentication failed | Verify JIRA_USERNAME matches your Atlassian email and API token is valid |
| No issues returned | Check JIRA_PROJECTS_FILTER is set to the correct project key |
| Permission denied on create | Ensure the API token user has create permission in the target project |
| Transition failed | Verify the target status is valid for the issue's current workflow state |
