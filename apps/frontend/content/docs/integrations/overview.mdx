# Integrations Overview

Integrations connect your agents to external services—CRM systems, communication platforms, productivity tools, and knowledge sources. AgentC2 supports three integration architectures: MCP-based tools (Model Context Protocol), OAuth-native APIs, and channel-native messaging platforms.

## Integration taxonomy

AgentC2 integrations fall into three categories based on their architecture and use case:

### 1. MCP-based integrations

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** expose tools that agents can call during conversations. MCP integrations use a standardized protocol for tool discovery and execution, enabling agents to interact with external APIs through a unified interface.

| Integration   | Category      | Use Case                                             |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **HubSpot**   | CRM           | Contacts, companies, deals, pipeline management      |
| **Jira**      | Productivity  | Issue tracking, sprint management, project workflows |
| **GitHub**    | Productivity  | Repository management, issues, PRs, code search      |
| **Firecrawl** | Web           | Web scraping and content extraction                  |
| **Fathom**    | Knowledge     | Meeting recordings, transcripts, summaries           |
| **JustCall**  | Communication | Phone logs, SMS messaging                            |

MCP tools are namespaced with the server name (e.g., `hubspot_hubspot-get-contact`) and are discovered dynamically when an integration connection is active.

<Callout type="info">
    MCP integrations require API keys or tokens configured at the organization level. Once
    connected, all agents in your workspace can use the available tools.
</Callout>

### 2. OAuth-native integrations

**Direct OAuth2 integrations** connect to services that require user consent and token-based authentication. These integrations use encrypted credential storage and automatic token refresh.

| Integration           | Category      | Use Case                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Gmail**             | Communication | Email read, send, archive via Google OAuth      |
| **Google Calendar**   | Productivity  | Calendar events CRUD via Google OAuth           |
| **Google Drive**      | Productivity  | File search, read, create via Google OAuth      |
| **Microsoft Outlook** | Communication | Mail and Calendar via Microsoft Graph API       |
| **Dropbox**           | Productivity  | File storage, sharing, search via Dropbox OAuth |

OAuth integrations store encrypted tokens and automatically refresh them when they expire. Each organization can have multiple connections (e.g., different Gmail accounts).

<Callout type="tip">
    OAuth integrations use AES-256-GCM encryption for token storage. The `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
    environment variable must be set for production deployments.
</Callout>

### 3. Channel-native integrations

**Messaging platform integrations** enable two-way conversations where agents respond directly in communication channels.

| Integration         | Category      | Use Case                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slack**           | Communication | Team messaging, channel conversations, DM support |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Communication | Team chat, channel posting, meeting integration   |

Channel integrations combine MCP tools (for reading/writing messages) with webhook handlers (for receiving events). Agents maintain separate conversation threads per channel thread.

## Providers and connections

AgentC2 manages integrations through two concepts:

### Integration providers

Providers define the available integration types on the platform. Each provider specifies its authentication method (`apiKey`, `oauth`, or `webhook`), category (CRM, communication, productivity, etc.), and the tools it exposes. Providers are pre-configured by the platform.

### Integration connections

Connections are organization-specific instances of a provider. For example, your organization might have a "Production HubSpot" connection and a "Sandbox HubSpot" connection, both using the HubSpot provider. Each connection stores:

- **Name** — A display name (e.g., "Production HubSpot")
- **Scope** — Organization-wide (`org`) or user-specific (`user`)
- **Credentials** — Encrypted API keys or OAuth tokens
- **Status** — Active/inactive state, last tested timestamp, and error details
- **Default flag** — Whether this is the default connection for the provider

You can mark a connection as the default so agents automatically use it when no specific connection is specified.

<Callout type="warning">
    When a connection is deleted, all related data (email threads, calendar events, webhook
    subscriptions) is removed. Use the `isActive` flag to temporarily disable a connection instead
    of deleting it.
</Callout>

## How to choose an integration approach

### Use MCP when:

- The service provides an MCP server (HubSpot, Jira, GitHub, Firecrawl)
- You need standardized tool discovery and execution
- Multiple agents should share the same integration credentials
- The integration exposes discrete tools (not streaming or real-time events)

### Use OAuth-native when:

- The service requires user consent (Gmail, Outlook, Dropbox)
- You need per-user or per-organization token management
- The service uses OAuth2 with PKCE (Google, Microsoft, Dropbox)
- You need automatic token refresh and encrypted storage

### Use channel-native when:

- The integration is a messaging platform (Slack, Teams)
- You need bidirectional conversations (users message the agent)
- Webhook events trigger agent responses
- Per-channel or per-thread conversation context is required

## Integration lifecycle

### 1. Discovery

Browse available integrations in the workspace UI (`/workspace/integrations`) or query the API:

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/integrations/providers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

The response includes provider metadata, required fields, and connection status:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "providers": [
        {
            "id": "provider-123",
            "key": "hubspot",
            "name": "HubSpot",
            "category": "crm",
            "authType": "apiKey",
            "providerType": "mcp",
            "status": "available",
            "connections": [],
            "toolCount": 12
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Setup

Configure credentials based on the integration type:

**MCP (API Key):**

```bash
# Set environment variables
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN="pat-na1-..."

# Or configure via UI: Settings > Integrations > HubSpot > Connect
```

**OAuth:**

```bash
# Navigate to integration setup page
# Complete OAuth flow (redirects to provider, then callback)
# Tokens are automatically stored encrypted
```

**Channel:**

```bash
# Configure OAuth app credentials
SLACK_CLIENT_ID="..."
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET="..."

# Install app to workspace
# Webhook URL: https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/slack/events
```

### 3. Connection testing

Test the connection to verify credentials and tool availability:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/integrations/connections/{connectionId}/test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

The test endpoint:

- Validates credentials
- Discovers available tools (for MCP)
- Checks token validity (for OAuth)
- Updates `lastTestedAt` and `errorMessage` fields

### 4. Tool attachment

Attach integration tools to agents:

```bash
# List available tools from active connections
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Attach MCP tool to agent
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/sales-assistant/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "toolId": "hubspot_hubspot-get-contact"
  }'
```

### 5. Monitoring

Track integration health and usage:

```bash
# View connection status
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/integrations/connections \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Check integration events (lifecycle logs)
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/integrations/connections/{connectionId}/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Integration events log:

- Connection creation, testing, failures
- Token refresh success/failure
- Health check results
- Tool discovery counts

## Integration security

### Credential encryption

All OAuth tokens and sensitive credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. API keys for MCP integrations are also stored securely within connection credentials.

### Scope isolation

- **Organization-scoped**: Connections belong to an organization. Users in the same org share access.
- **User-scoped**: Connections belong to a specific user (e.g., personal Gmail). Only that user's agents can access.

### Token refresh

OAuth integrations automatically refresh expired tokens when an API call is made. If a refresh fails, the connection is marked inactive with error details so you can re-authenticate.

## Common patterns

### Multi-connection strategy

Use multiple connections for different environments:

```bash
# Production HubSpot
POST /api/integrations/connections
{
  "providerKey": "hubspot",
  "name": "Production HubSpot",
  "credentials": { "HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN": "pat-prod-..." },
  "isDefault": true
}

# Sandbox HubSpot
POST /api/integrations/connections
{
  "providerKey": "hubspot",
  "name": "Sandbox HubSpot",
  "credentials": { "HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN": "pat-sandbox-..." },
  "isDefault": false
}
```

Agents can specify which connection to use via tool configuration, or the default connection is used.

### OAuth sibling providers

Google integrations (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) share OAuth credentials. A single Google OAuth connection automatically enables tools for all three services — email, calendar, and drive. Similarly, a Microsoft Outlook connection enables both Mail and Calendar tools from one OAuth flow.
