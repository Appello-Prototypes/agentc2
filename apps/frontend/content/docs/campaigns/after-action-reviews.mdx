# After-Action Reviews

After-action reviews (AARs) are automated analyses of campaign execution that compare planned vs actual outcomes, extract lessons learned, and feed findings back into agent and workflow improvements.

## What are AARs?

An after-action review (AAR) is a structured analysis of campaign execution that:

- **Compares plan vs actual**: How did execution differ from the plan?
- **Identifies successes**: What worked well?
- **Identifies failures**: What didn't work?
- **Extracts lessons**: What can we learn?
- **Recommends improvements**: How can we do better next time?

AARs are automatically generated after campaign completion and stored in the `aarJson` field.

## AAR structure

AARs follow a standardized structure:

```json
{
    "campaignId": "camp_abc123",
    "campaignName": "Support Optimization Campaign",
    "executionSummary": {
        "status": "COMPLETE",
        "durationMinutes": 720,

    },

        }
    ],
    "generatedAt": "2026-02-18T18:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Automated generation

AARs are automatically generated when campaigns complete:

### Generation trigger

AARs are generated:

- **On completion**: When campaign status changes to `COMPLETE`
- **On failure**: When campaign status changes to `FAILED`
- **On manual request**: Via API endpoint

### Generation process

1. **Data collection**: Gather execution data (costs, durations, outcomes)
2. **Plan comparison**: Compare actual vs planned metrics
3. **Signal extraction**: Extract performance signals
4. **Analysis**: Identify successes, failures, lessons
5. **Recommendations**: Generate improvement recommendations
6. **Storage**: Store AAR in `aarJson` field

### Accessing AARs

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/{campaignId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Response includes `aarJson`:

```json
{
  "id": "camp_abc123",
  "status": "COMPLETE",
  "aarJson": {
    "executionSummary": {...},
    "planVsActual": {...},
    "lessonsLearned": [...],
    "recommendations": [...]
  }
}
```

## Signal extraction

AARs extract performance signals from execution data:

### Signal types

| Type            | Description                           | Example                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Performance** | Performance improvements/degradations | Resolution time reduced by 45% |
| **Cost**        | Cost efficiency signals               | Budget underrun by 10%         |
| **Quality**     | Quality improvements                  | Satisfaction score increased   |
| **Efficiency**  | Efficiency gains                      | Tasks completed 20% faster     |

### Signal extraction process

1. **Metric calculation**: Calculate key metrics (cost, duration, success rate)
2. **Variance analysis**: Compare actual vs planned
3. **Significance testing**: Determine if variance is significant
4. **Signal classification**: Classify signals by type and direction

### Example signals

```json
{
    "signals": [
        {
            "type": "performance",
            "metric": "resolution_time",
            "value": 0.45,
            "direction": "improvement",
            "significance": "high",
            "description": "Resolution time reduced by 45%"
        },
        {
            "type": "cost",
            "metric": "budget_variance",
            "value": -0.1,
            "direction": "efficiency",
            "significance": "medium",
            "description": "Budget underrun by 10%"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Feeding findings back

AAR findings feed back into agent and workflow improvements:

### Agent improvements

AARs suggest agent improvements:

```json
{
    "agentImprovements": [
        {
            "agentId": "support-agent-id",
            "suggestion": "Add ticket categorization tool",
            "rationale": "Would improve routing accuracy",
            "priority": "high",
            "estimatedImpact": "Reduce routing errors by 30%"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Workflow improvements

AARs suggest workflow improvements:

```json
{
    "workflowImprovements": [
        {
            "workflowId": "ticket-routing-workflow-id",
            "suggestion": "Add fallback routing for edge cases",
            "rationale": "Would reduce manual intervention",
            "priority": "medium",
            "estimatedImpact": "Reduce manual routing by 20%"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Applying improvements

Manually apply AAR recommendations:

```bash
# Update agent with AAR suggestion
curl -X PATCH https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/support-agent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tools": ["ticket-categorization-tool"]
  }'

# Update workflow with AAR suggestion
curl -X PUT https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/workflows/ticket-routing-workflow \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "steps": [
      {...},
      {"type": "fallback", "condition": "edge_case"}
    ]
  }'
```

## AAR analysis

Analyze AARs across multiple campaigns:

### Aggregate AAR analysis

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/aars/aggregate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "templateId": "customer-onboarding",
    "fromDate": "2026-01-01",
    "toDate": "2026-02-18"
  }'
```

### Common patterns

Identify common patterns across AARs:

- **Recurring failures**: Same issues across multiple campaigns
- **Success factors**: What consistently works well
- **Cost trends**: Budget estimation accuracy over time
- **Performance trends**: Performance improvements/degradations

## Manual AAR generation

Generate AARs manually:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/{campaignId}/aar \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "forceRegenerate": true
  }'
```

## Best practices

### 1. Review AARs regularly

Review AARs after each campaign to identify improvements:

```bash
# List recent campaigns with AARs
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns?status=COMPLETE&includeAAR=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 2. Apply recommendations

Act on AAR recommendations to improve future campaigns:

- **High priority**: Apply immediately
- **Medium priority**: Plan for next campaign
- **Low priority**: Consider for future

### 3. Track improvements

Track whether AAR recommendations improve outcomes:

- **Before**: Baseline metrics
- **After**: Metrics after applying recommendations
- **Comparison**: Measure improvement
