# Campaigns Overview

Campaigns are mission-style operations that decompose high-level intent into end states, missions, and tasks. They orchestrate multiple agents and workflows to execute complex multi-step operations with budget controls, approval workflows, and after-action reviews.

## What are campaigns?

A campaign in AgentC2 is a database-driven mission command system that breaks down complex objectives into executable tasks. Campaigns follow military-style mission command principles: define intent (the WHY), specify end state (the WHAT), decompose into missions and tasks (the HOW), assign agents, execute with constraints, and review outcomes.

Campaigns are stored in PostgreSQL and executed via Inngest background jobs, enabling long-running operations, parallel execution, and comprehensive observability.

## Campaign decomposition

Campaigns follow a hierarchical decomposition:

```
Intent (WHY)
  ↓
End State (WHAT)
  ↓
Missions (HOW - high-level)
  ↓
Tasks (HOW - executable)
  ↓
Agent Execution
```

### Intent

The commander's intent: **WHY** this campaign exists.

Example: "Improve customer satisfaction by reducing support ticket resolution time by 50% within Q2."

### End State

The desired end state: **WHAT** success looks like.

Example: "Support tickets resolved in under 2 hours on average, with customer satisfaction scores above 4.5/5."

### Missions

High-level missions that achieve the end state: **HOW** to get there.

Example missions:
- "Analyze current support ticket patterns"
- "Implement automated ticket routing"
- "Train support agents on new processes"

### Tasks

Executable tasks within missions: **HOW** to execute each mission.

Example tasks:
- "Query support database for ticket patterns"
- "Create ticket routing workflow"
- "Generate training materials"

## Campaign model

Campaigns are defined by the following core fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique campaign ID |
| `slug` | string | URL-safe identifier |
| `name` | string | Display name |
| `status` | enum | `PLANNING`, `ANALYZING`, `READY`, `EXECUTING`, `REVIEWING`, `COMPLETE`, `FAILED`, `PAUSED` |
| `intent` | text | Commander's intent (WHY) |
| `endState` | text | Desired end state (WHAT) |
| `description` | text | Additional context |
| `constraints` | string[] | Must-do requirements |
| `restraints` | string[] | Must-not-do requirements |
| `analysisOutput` | JSON | Task decomposition output |
| `executionPlan` | JSON | Phases, resource allocation, dependencies |
| `aarJson` | JSON | After-action review data |
| `requireApproval` | boolean | Pause for human review before execution |
| `maxCostUsd` | number | Budget ceiling |
| `timeoutMinutes` | number | Maximum execution time |
| `totalCostUsd` | number | Actual cost incurred |
| `progress` | number | Completion percentage (0-100) |

## When to use campaigns

Campaigns excel when:

- **Complex objectives**: Multi-step operations requiring coordination
- **Mission-style planning**: Decompose intent into executable tasks
- **Agent orchestration**: Coordinate multiple agents and workflows
- **Budget control**: Enforce spending limits
- **Approval workflows**: Require human review before execution
- **After-action reviews**: Learn from execution outcomes

<Callout type="info">
Use **campaigns** for complex, multi-step operations. Use **agents** for single-agent tasks. Use **networks** for multi-agent routing. Use **workflows** for deterministic processes.
</Callout>

## Campaign lifecycle

Every campaign follows a predictable lifecycle:

### 1. Planning

Define intent, end state, constraints, and restraints:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Support Optimization Campaign",
    "intent": "Improve customer satisfaction by reducing support ticket resolution time by 50% within Q2",
    "endState": "Support tickets resolved in under 2 hours on average, with customer satisfaction scores above 4.5/5",
    "constraints": ["Must maintain data privacy", "Must comply with SLAs"],
    "restraints": ["Cannot exceed $10,000 budget", "Cannot disrupt existing workflows"]
  }'
```

### 2. Analysis

Campaign is analyzed and decomposed into missions and tasks:

- **Task decomposition**: Intent → end state → missions → tasks
- **Agent assignment**: Assign agents to tasks
- **Dependency mapping**: Map task dependencies
- **Resource allocation**: Estimate costs and timelines

### 3. Ready

Campaign is ready for execution:

- **Execution plan**: Complete plan with phases and dependencies
- **Approval**: If `requireApproval: true`, waits for human approval
- **Budget check**: Verifies budget limits

### 4. Executing

Campaign executes missions and tasks:

- **Parallel execution**: Independent tasks run in parallel
- **Sequential execution**: Dependent tasks run in sequence
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress updates
- **Cost tracking**: Monitor spending against budget

### 5. Reviewing

After execution, campaign enters review phase:

- **After-action review**: Automated AAR generation
- **Signal extraction**: Extract lessons learned
- **Outcome analysis**: Compare plan vs actual

### 6. Complete

Campaign is marked complete:

- **Final metrics**: Total cost, duration, success rate
- **AAR summary**: After-action review summary
- **Lessons learned**: Key takeaways for future campaigns

## Campaign capabilities

| Capability | Description | Example Use Case |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Intent Decomposition** | Break down intent into missions and tasks | "Improve customer satisfaction" → missions → tasks |
| **Agent Orchestration** | Coordinate multiple agents and workflows | Research agent → Analysis agent → Writing agent |
| **Budget Control** | Enforce spending limits | Max $10,000, auto-pause if exceeded |
| **Approval Workflows** | Require human review before execution | Pause for stakeholder approval |
| **After-Action Reviews** | Automated AAR generation | Extract lessons learned, compare plan vs actual |
| **Progress Tracking** | Real-time progress updates | 45% complete, 3/7 missions done |
| **Cost Tracking** | Monitor spending | $2,500 / $10,000 budget used |
| **Template Support** | Reusable campaign templates | "Q2 Support Optimization" template |

## Campaign types

### Ad-hoc campaigns

One-time campaigns created manually:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "One-time Campaign",
    "intent": "...",
    "endState": "..."
  }'
```

### Template-based campaigns

Campaigns created from templates:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "templateId": "template_abc123",
    "parameterValues": {
      "customerName": "Acme Corp",
      "targetDate": "2026-06-30"
    }
  }'
```

### Scheduled campaigns

Recurring campaigns via templates and schedules:

```bash
# Create schedule for template
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/templates/{templateId}/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Monthly Review",
    "cronExpr": "0 0 1 * *",
    "inputJson": {
      "parameterValues": {...}
    }
  }'
```
