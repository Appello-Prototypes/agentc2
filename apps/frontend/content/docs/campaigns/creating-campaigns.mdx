# Creating Campaigns

Create campaigns in AgentC2 via the REST API. Campaigns decompose intent into end states, missions, and tasks, then execute with agent orchestration, budget controls, and approval workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a campaign, ensure you have:

- An AgentC2 account with authentication configured
- At least one agent created (for task execution)
- (Optional) A campaign template (for template-based campaigns)

## Create via API

Send a `POST` request to `/agent/api/campaigns` with campaign configuration:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Support Optimization Campaign",
    "intent": "Improve customer satisfaction by reducing support ticket resolution time by 50% within Q2",
    "endState": "Support tickets resolved in under 2 hours on average, with customer satisfaction scores above 4.5/5",
    "description": "Q2 2026 support optimization initiative",
    "constraints": [
      "Must maintain data privacy",
      "Must comply with existing SLAs",
      "Must preserve customer relationships"
    ],
    "restraints": [
      "Cannot exceed $10,000 budget",
      "Cannot disrupt existing support workflows",
      "Cannot reduce support team size"
    ],
    "requireApproval": true,
    "maxCostUsd": 10000,
    "timeoutMinutes": 1440
  }'
```

### Response format

Successful creation returns:

```json
{
  "id": "camp_abc123",
  "slug": "support-optimization-campaign-...",
  "name": "Support Optimization Campaign",
  "status": "PLANNING",
  "intent": "Improve customer satisfaction...",
  "endState": "Support tickets resolved...",
  "constraints": [...],
  "restraints": [...],
  "requireApproval": true,
  "maxCostUsd": 10000,
  "timeoutMinutes": 1440,
  "totalCostUsd": 0,
  "progress": 0,
  "createdAt": "2026-02-18T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Defining intent and end state

### Intent (WHY)

The commander's intent explains **WHY** the campaign exists:

**Good intent examples**:

- "Improve customer satisfaction by reducing support ticket resolution time by 50% within Q2"
- "Increase sales revenue by 25% through improved lead qualification and follow-up"
- "Reduce operational costs by automating manual processes"

**Vague intent examples** (avoid):

- "Improve things"
- "Make it better"
- "Fix problems"

### End State (WHAT)

The desired end state describes **WHAT** success looks like:

**Good end state examples**:

- "Support tickets resolved in under 2 hours on average, with customer satisfaction scores above 4.5/5"
- "Sales pipeline conversion rate increased from 15% to 20%, with average deal size up 10%"
- "Manual process time reduced by 80%, with zero errors"

**Vague end state examples** (avoid):

- "Things are better"
- "Problems are fixed"
- "Goals are met"

## Mission decomposition

After creation, campaigns are automatically analyzed and decomposed:

### Analysis phase

The campaign enters `ANALYZING` status and an Inngest job processes it:

1. **Intent analysis**: Understands the intent and end state
2. **Mission generation**: Creates high-level missions
3. **Task decomposition**: Breaks missions into executable tasks
4. **Agent assignment**: Assigns agents to tasks
5. **Dependency mapping**: Maps task dependencies
6. **Resource estimation**: Estimates costs and timelines

### Analysis output

The `analysisOutput` field contains the decomposition:

```json
{
    "missions": [
        {
            "id": "mission_1",
            "name": "Analyze Current Support Patterns",
            "sequence": 1,
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "id": "task_1",
                    "type": "ASSIGNED",
                    "name": "Query support database for ticket patterns",
                    "agentId": "research-agent-id",
                    "estimatedCostUsd": 5.0
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "estimatedTotalCostUsd": 5000,
    "estimatedDurationMinutes": 720
}
```

## Agent assignment

Tasks are assigned to agents based on:

- **Task requirements**: What capabilities are needed
- **Agent capabilities**: Which agents have the right tools
- **Agent availability**: Which agents are active
- **Cost optimization**: Minimize total cost

### Manual agent assignment

Override automatic assignment:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/{campaignId}/missions/{missionId}/tasks/{taskId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "custom-agent-id"
  }'
```

## Constraints and restraints

### Constraints (Must-do)

Requirements that **must** be satisfied:

```json
{
    "constraints": [
        "Must maintain data privacy",
        "Must comply with existing SLAs",
        "Must preserve customer relationships"
    ]
}
```

Constraints are enforced during execution. Tasks that violate constraints are rejected.

### Restraints (Must-not-do)

Requirements that **must not** be violated:

```json
{
    "restraints": [
        "Cannot exceed $10,000 budget",
        "Cannot disrupt existing support workflows",
        "Cannot reduce support team size"
    ]
}
```

Restraints are enforced during execution. Tasks that violate restraints are rejected.

## Budget limits

Set budget limits to control spending:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Budgeted Campaign",
    "intent": "...",
    "endState": "...",
    "maxCostUsd": 10000
  }'
```

### Budget enforcement

- **Pre-execution**: Estimated cost checked against budget
- **During execution**: Actual cost tracked in real-time
- **Budget exceeded**: Campaign paused if `totalCostUsd >= maxCostUsd`

### Budget tracking

Monitor spending:

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/{campaignId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Response includes:

```json
{
    "maxCostUsd": 10000,
    "totalCostUsd": 2500,
    "remainingBudgetUsd": 7500
}
```

## Approval workflows

Require human approval before execution:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Approval Required Campaign",
    "intent": "...",
    "endState": "...",
    "requireApproval": true
  }'
```

### Approval process

1. **Campaign created**: Status = `PLANNING`
2. **Analysis completes**: Status = `ANALYZING` → `READY`
3. **Approval required**: Status = `READY`, waits for approval
4. **Human approves**: Status = `READY` → `EXECUTING`
5. **Execution**: Campaign executes missions and tasks

### Approve campaign

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/{campaignId}/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "approved": true,
    "notes": "Approved for execution"
  }'
```

## Example campaign

Complete example: Support optimization campaign

```bash
# Step 1: Create campaign
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Support Optimization Campaign",
    "intent": "Improve customer satisfaction by reducing support ticket resolution time by 50% within Q2",
    "endState": "Support tickets resolved in under 2 hours on average, with customer satisfaction scores above 4.5/5",
    "description": "Q2 2026 support optimization initiative",
    "constraints": [
      "Must maintain data privacy",
      "Must comply with existing SLAs"
    ],
    "restraints": [
      "Cannot exceed $10,000 budget",
      "Cannot disrupt existing workflows"
    ],
    "requireApproval": true,
    "maxCostUsd": 10000,
    "timeoutMinutes": 1440
  }'

# Step 2: Wait for analysis (status: ANALYZING → READY)
# Check status
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/{campaignId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Step 3: Approve campaign (if requireApproval: true)
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/{campaignId}/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "approved": true
  }'

# Step 4: Campaign executes (status: EXECUTING)
# Monitor progress
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/campaigns/{campaignId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
