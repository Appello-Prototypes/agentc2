# Deploy to Slack

This guide walks you through deploying an agent to Slack so your team can chat with it by @mentioning it in channels or sending direct messages.

## What you'll get

- **@mention support** -- @mention your bot in any channel and get a threaded response
- **Direct messages** -- Send DMs to the bot for private conversations
- **Multi-agent routing** -- Route to different agents with `agent:research` or `agent:sales` prefixes
- **Conversation memory** -- Each Slack thread maintains its own conversation context

## Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App** > **From scratch**
3. Name your app and select your workspace

## Step 2: Configure bot permissions

Under **OAuth & Permissions**, add these bot token scopes:

- `app_mentions:read` -- Receive @mentions
- `chat:write` -- Send messages
- `im:history` -- Read DM history
- `im:read` -- Access DM metadata
- `channels:history` -- Read channel messages

## Step 3: Enable event subscriptions

Under **Event Subscriptions**:

1. Turn on **Enable Events**
2. Set the Request URL to your AgentC2 Slack webhook endpoint
3. Subscribe to `app_mention` and `message.im` events

## Step 4: Install and connect

1. Go to **Install App** and click **Install to Workspace**
2. Copy the Bot User OAuth Token
3. In AgentC2, go to **Integrations** > **Slack** > **Connect**
4. Paste your bot token and signing secret

## Step 5: Test

1. Add your bot to a Slack channel
2. @mention it with a question: `@YourBot What can you help me with?`
3. The bot responds in a thread

### Multi-agent routing

Your team can route to specific agents by prefixing messages:

- `@YourBot agent:research What is quantum computing?` -- routes to the research agent
- `@YourBot agent:sales Find leads in HubSpot` -- routes to the sales agent
- `@YourBot help` -- lists all available agents

- **[Build a Customer Support Agent](/docs/guides/build-a-customer-support-agent)** -- Build a support agent for Slack
