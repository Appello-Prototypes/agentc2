# Multi-Agent Orchestration

This guide walks you through building a 3-agent network where a coordinator agent routes tasks to specialist agents (researcher and writer), and a verifier agent ensures quality. By the end, you'll understand how to design agent networks with clear responsibilities, delegation patterns, and quality verification.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- An AgentC2 account with authentication configured
- API keys for OpenAI or Anthropic
- Understanding of basic agent creation
- (Optional) Tools configured for research (Firecrawl, RAG)

<Callout type="info">
    Multi-agent systems excel when tasks require different expertise. This guide shows how to coordinate specialists while maintaining quality through verification.
</Callout>

## Architecture overview

Your network will consist of:

1. **Coordinator Agent** — Routes tasks to appropriate specialists
2. **Researcher Agent** — Gathers information from multiple sources
3. **Writer Agent** — Synthesizes findings into polished output
4. **Verifier Agent** — Validates quality and completeness

## Step 1: Create the researcher agent

Create a specialist agent focused on information gathering:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Researcher Agent",
    "slug": "researcher",
    "description": "Specializes in gathering information from multiple sources",
    "instructions": "You are a research specialist. Your role is to gather comprehensive information on assigned topics.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Break down the research question into sub-topics\n2. Identify relevant sources (web, documents, databases)\n3. Gather information from multiple sources\n4. Verify facts across sources\n5. Organize findings into structured notes\n\n**Output Format:**\n- Executive summary (2-3 sentences)\n- Key findings (bullet points with citations)\n- Sources consulted (list with URLs/document IDs)\n- Gaps or uncertainties\n\n**Quality Standards:**\n- Use at least 3 sources per major claim\n- Distinguish facts from opinions\n- Note contradictions\n- Flag incomplete information",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "maxTokens": 4000,
    "memoryEnabled": false,
    "maxSteps": 20,
    "tools": ["web-fetch", "rag-query"],
    "metadata": {
      "role": "specialist",
      "specialization": "research"
    }
  }'
```

### Key characteristics

| Aspect | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Temperature** | 0.3 | Low for factual accuracy |
| **Memory** | Disabled | Stateless—each research task is independent |
| **Max Steps** | 20 | Multiple tool calls for thorough research |
| **Tools** | web-fetch, rag-query | Access to web and document sources |

## Step 2: Create the writer agent

Create a specialist agent focused on content creation:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Writer Agent",
    "slug": "writer",
    "description": "Specializes in synthesizing research into polished written content",
    "instructions": "You are a writing specialist. Your role is to transform research findings into polished, engaging content.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Review research findings provided\n2. Identify key themes and insights\n3. Structure content logically\n4. Write clear, engaging prose\n5. Ensure proper citations\n\n**Writing Style:**\n- Clear and concise\n- Engaging but professional\n- Well-structured with headings\n- Proper citations throughout\n- Appropriate tone for audience\n\n**Output Formats:**\n- Articles and blog posts\n- Reports and summaries\n- Documentation\n- Marketing copy\n\n**Quality Standards:**\n- No unsupported claims\n- All facts cited\n- Logical flow\n- Appropriate length\n- Grammar and style consistency",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "maxTokens": 6000,
    "memoryEnabled": false,
    "maxSteps": 10,
    "tools": [],
    "metadata": {
      "role": "specialist",
      "specialization": "writing"
    }
  }'
```

### Key characteristics

| Aspect | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Temperature** | 0.7 | Higher for creative writing |
| **Memory** | Disabled | Stateless—works from provided research |
| **Max Steps** | 10 | Fewer tool calls, more text generation |
| **Tools** | None | Focuses on writing, not research |

## Step 3: Create the verifier agent

Create an agent that validates quality and completeness:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Verifier Agent",
    "slug": "verifier",
    "description": "Validates quality, completeness, and accuracy of agent outputs",
    "instructions": "You are a quality verification specialist. Your role is to validate outputs from other agents.\n\n**Verification Checklist:**\n\n1. **Completeness**\n   - Does the output address all requirements?\n   - Are all questions answered?\n   - Is the scope appropriate?\n\n2. **Accuracy**\n   - Are facts correct?\n   - Are citations valid?\n   - Are claims supported?\n\n3. **Quality**\n   - Is the writing clear and engaging?\n   - Is the structure logical?\n   - Are there grammar or style issues?\n\n4. **Compliance**\n   - Does it meet specified guidelines?\n   - Are guardrails respected?\n   - Is the tone appropriate?\n\n**Output Format:**\n- Overall assessment: PASS / FAIL / NEEDS_REVISION\n- Score (0-100)\n- Specific issues found (if any)\n- Recommendations for improvement\n\n**Scoring:**\n- 90-100: Excellent, ready for use\n- 70-89: Good, minor improvements needed\n- 50-69: Needs revision\n- <50: Significant issues, requires rework",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "maxTokens": 2000,
    "memoryEnabled": false,
    "maxSteps": 5,
    "tools": [],
    "metadata": {
      "role": "verifier",
      "specialization": "quality-assurance"
    }
  }'
```

### Key characteristics

| Aspect | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Temperature** | 0.2 | Very low for consistent, objective evaluation |
| **Memory** | Disabled | Evaluates each output independently |
| **Max Steps** | 5 | Minimal processing, focused evaluation |
| **Tools** | None | Evaluates provided content only |

## Step 4: Create the coordinator agent

Create the coordinator that routes tasks and orchestrates the network:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Coordinator Agent",
    "slug": "coordinator",
    "description": "Routes tasks to specialist agents and coordinates multi-agent workflows",
    "instructions": "You are a coordinator agent that routes tasks to specialist agents.\n\n**Available Specialists:**\n- **researcher**: For gathering information, conducting research, finding sources\n- **writer**: For creating written content, synthesizing information, writing articles\n- **verifier**: For quality checking, validation, review\n\n**Routing Logic:**\n1. Analyze the user request\n2. Determine required capabilities\n3. Delegate to appropriate specialist(s)\n4. Coordinate handoffs between agents\n5. Collect and synthesize final output\n\n**Delegation Patterns:**\n- **Research + Write**: Delegate to researcher first, then writer\n- **Write Only**: Delegate directly to writer (if research already done)\n- **Verify**: Always delegate to verifier after writing\n- **Research Only**: Delegate to researcher, return findings\n\n**Coordination:**\n- Pass research findings to writer\n- Pass written content to verifier\n- If verifier finds issues, route back to writer for revision\n- Only return final output when verifier passes\n\n**Output:**\n- Final deliverable\n- Summary of agent contributions\n- Verification results",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "maxTokens": 4000,
    "memoryEnabled": true,
    "memoryConfig": {
      "lastMessages": 20
    },
    "maxSteps": 30,
    "subAgents": ["researcher", "writer", "verifier"],
    "metadata": {
      "role": "coordinator",
      "network": "research-writer-verifier"
    }
  }'
```

### Key characteristics

| Aspect | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **SubAgents** | researcher, writer, verifier | Can delegate to these agents |
| **Max Steps** | 30 | Multiple delegation rounds |
| **Memory** | Enabled | Tracks conversation and delegation history |
| **Temperature** | 0.5 | Balanced for routing decisions |

<Callout type="info">
    The coordinator uses `subAgents` to delegate tasks. When it calls a sub-agent, that agent runs independently and returns results.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Test individual agents

Before building the network, test each agent independently:

### Test researcher

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/researcher/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Research the latest developments in AI agent frameworks in 2026. Use at least 3 sources and provide structured findings."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Verify:
- ✅ Multiple sources consulted
- ✅ Structured findings
- ✅ Citations provided

### Test writer

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/writer/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a 500-word article based on these research findings:\n\n[Research findings from researcher]\n\nMake it engaging and well-structured with proper citations."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Verify:
- ✅ Clear structure
- ✅ Engaging prose
- ✅ Citations included

### Test verifier

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/verifier/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Verify this content for quality, completeness, and accuracy:\n\n[Content from writer]\n\nProvide a score and specific feedback."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Verify:
- ✅ Objective assessment
- ✅ Specific issues identified
- ✅ Actionable recommendations

## Step 6: Test coordinator delegation

Test the coordinator's ability to delegate:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/coordinator/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I need a comprehensive article about AI agent frameworks. Research the topic thoroughly and write a polished 1000-word article."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Expected flow:
1. Coordinator analyzes request
2. Delegates to researcher for information gathering
3. Receives research findings
4. Delegates to writer with research findings
5. Receives written article
6. Delegates to verifier for quality check
7. Returns final verified article

### Inspect delegation trace

Check the run trace to see delegation:

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/coordinator/runs?limit=1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Look for:
- Sub-agent invocations
- Handoff points
- Data passed between agents

## Step 7: Create a network topology

Create a formal network definition with explicit topology:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Research-Writer-Verifier Network",
    "slug": "research-writer-network",
    "description": "Multi-agent network for research and content creation with quality verification",
    "topologyJson": {
      "type": "router",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "coordinator",
          "agentSlug": "coordinator",
          "role": "router",
          "routingRules": [
            {
              "condition": "requiresResearch",
              "target": "researcher"
            },
            {
              "condition": "requiresWriting",
              "target": "writer"
            },
            {
              "condition": "requiresVerification",
              "target": "verifier"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": "researcher",
          "agentSlug": "researcher",
          "role": "specialist"
        },
        {
          "id": "writer",
          "agentSlug": "writer",
          "role": "specialist"
        },
        {
          "id": "verifier",
          "agentSlug": "verifier",
          "role": "verifier"
        }
      ],
      "edges": [
        {
          "from": "coordinator",
          "to": "researcher",
          "condition": "researchNeeded"
        },
        {
          "from": "researcher",
          "to": "writer",
          "condition": "always"
        },
        {
          "from": "writer",
          "to": "verifier",
          "condition": "always"
        },
        {
          "from": "verifier",
          "to": "writer",
          "condition": "needsRevision"
        },
        {
          "from": "verifier",
          "to": "coordinator",
          "condition": "passed"
        }
      ]
    },
    "inputSchemaJson": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "task": { "type": "string" },
        "requirements": { "type": "string" },
        "outputFormat": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["task"]
    }
  }'
```

<Callout type="tip">
    Networks provide explicit topology and routing rules, making delegation patterns clear and debuggable. Use networks for complex multi-agent workflows.
</Callout>

## Step 8: Test the network

Execute the network with a complex task:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-writer-network/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {
      "task": "Create a comprehensive guide to AI agent orchestration",
      "requirements": "1000 words, well-researched, engaging, properly cited",
      "outputFormat": "markdown article"
    }
  }'
```

The network will:
1. Route to researcher for information gathering
2. Pass findings to writer
3. Verify output quality
4. Return final article or request revision

## Step 9: Monitor handoff quality

Track how well agents hand off work:

### Review delegation success rate

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-writer-network/runs?limit=50 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Metrics to track:
- **Delegation success rate**: Successful handoffs / total handoffs
- **Revision rate**: Verifier requests revision / total verifications
- **End-to-end success**: Completed tasks / total tasks

### Analyze handoff data

Check what data is passed between agents:

```bash
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-writer-network/runs/run_abc123/traces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Look for:
- Complete data transfer
- Proper formatting
- No information loss

## Step 10: Add fallback handling

Enhance the coordinator to handle failures:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/coordinator \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instructions": "You are a coordinator agent that routes tasks to specialist agents.\n\n**Failure Handling:**\n\nIf a specialist agent fails or returns insufficient output:\n1. Log the failure\n2. Try an alternative approach\n3. If researcher fails: Use web-fetch directly\n4. If writer fails: Provide more detailed instructions\n5. If verifier fails: Use basic quality checks\n6. If all else fails: Return partial results with explanation\n\n**Fallback Strategies:**\n- Researcher unavailable: Use web-fetch tool directly\n- Writer unavailable: Return research findings as-is\n- Verifier unavailable: Perform basic checks yourself\n\n**Always:**\n- Inform user of any failures\n- Provide partial results when possible\n- Suggest manual review for critical tasks"
  }'
```

## Step 11: Optimize delegation patterns

Refine routing logic based on performance:

### Add routing confidence

```bash
curl -X PUT https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/coordinator \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instructions": "You are a coordinator agent that routes tasks to specialist agents.\n\n**Routing Confidence:**\n\nBefore delegating, assess:\n- Task complexity (simple/complex)\n- Required expertise (research/writing/verification)\n- Expected output quality\n\n**Confidence Levels:**\n- High (>0.8): Delegate directly\n- Medium (0.5-0.8): Delegate with detailed instructions\n- Low (<0.5): Break task into smaller parts\n\n**Optimization:**\n- For simple tasks: Skip unnecessary steps\n- For complex tasks: Use full pipeline\n- For urgent tasks: Parallelize where possible"
  }'
```

## Step 12: Add parallel execution

Enable parallel research for faster results:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/coordinator \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instructions": "You are a coordinator agent that routes tasks to specialist agents.\n\n**Parallel Execution:**\n\nFor research tasks with multiple sub-topics:\n1. Break into independent sub-tasks\n2. Delegate to multiple researcher instances (if supported)\n3. Collect results in parallel\n4. Synthesize findings\n\n**When to Parallelize:**\n- Multiple independent research questions\n- Different source types (web vs documents)\n- Non-dependent sub-tasks\n\n**When NOT to Parallelize:**\n- Sequential dependencies\n- Limited resources\n- Simple tasks"
  }'
```
