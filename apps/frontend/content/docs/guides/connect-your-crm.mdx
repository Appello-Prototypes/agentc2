# Connect Your CRM

This guide walks you through connecting HubSpot or Jira to AgentC2 and building an agent that can search contacts, update deals, or manage issues.

## Option A: Connect HubSpot

### Step 1: Get your HubSpot API key

1. Log in to your HubSpot account
2. Go to **Settings > Integrations > Private Apps**
3. Create a new private app with the scopes your agents will need (contacts, companies, deals)
4. Copy the access token

### Step 2: Connect in AgentC2

1. Go to **Integrations** in the workspace sidebar
2. Find **HubSpot** and click **Connect**
3. Paste your access token
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify

### Step 3: Attach tools to an agent

1. Open your agent's configuration
2. Under **Tools**, you'll see HubSpot tools available (search contacts, get company details, create deals, etc.)
3. Select the tools relevant to your use case
4. Save

### Step 4: Test

Chat with your agent:

- _"Find all contacts from Acme Corp"_
- _"What deals are in the pipeline for this quarter?"_
- _"Create a new contact for jane@example.com"_

## Option B: Connect Jira

### Step 1: Get your Jira API token

1. Go to [id.atlassian.com](https://id.atlassian.com) and create an API token
2. Note your Jira URL (e.g., `your-org.atlassian.net`) and email

### Step 2: Connect in AgentC2

1. Go to **Integrations** and find **Jira**
2. Enter your Jira URL, email, and API token
3. Test the connection

### Step 3: Build an agent
