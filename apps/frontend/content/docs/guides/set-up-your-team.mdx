# Set Up Your Team

This guide walks you through inviting team members, assigning roles, and organizing your workspace so everyone can work with agents effectively.

## Step 1: Invite team members

1. Go to **Team** in the workspace sidebar
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email address
4. Choose a role

## Step 2: Assign roles

| Role       | What they can do                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**  | Full control -- billing, deletion, all settings      |
| **Admin**  | Manage members, workspaces, agents, and integrations |
| **Member** | Create and edit agents, run workflows, chat          |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access -- review outputs and runs          |

Assign the minimum permissions needed. You can always upgrade a role later.

## Step 3: Organize with workspaces

If your team works across different environments (development, staging, production), create separate workspaces:

- **Development** -- For building and testing new agents
- **Production** -- For agents that serve real users

Each workspace isolates its agents, documents, and runs. Integrations are shared across workspaces within your organization.

## Best practices

- Start everyone as **Member** and promote to **Admin** as needed
- Use **Viewer** for stakeholders who need to review outputs but not edit agents
- Keep production agents in a separate workspace from development experiments
