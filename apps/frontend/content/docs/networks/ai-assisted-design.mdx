# AI-Assisted Network Design

AI-assisted network design uses the designer chat endpoint to automatically generate network topologies from natural language descriptions. Describe your network requirements in plain English, and the system generates a complete topology JSON with nodes, edges, and primitive attachments.

## How it works

The designer chat uses the `assistant` agent to analyze your network requirements and generate a complete network definition:

1. **Describe your network** — Provide a natural language description of what you want
2. **AI generates topology** — The system creates nodes, edges, and primitive attachments
3. **Review and refine** — Validate the generated topology and make adjustments
4. **Deploy** — Use the generated topology to create your network

## Designer chat endpoint

Send a `POST` request to `/agent/api/networks/{slug}/designer-chat`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network/designer-chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Create a research network with a coordinator that routes research tasks to a research agent, analysis tasks to an analyst, and writing tasks to a writer. The coordinator should maintain context across all interactions."
  }'
```

### Response format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "topologyJson": {
    "nodes": [
      {"id": "coordinator", "type": "coordinator", "label": "Coordinator"},
      {"id": "researcher", "type": "agent", "label": "Research Agent"},
      {"id": "analyst", "type": "agent", "label": "Analysis Agent"},
      {"id": "writer", "type": "agent", "label": "Writing Agent"}
    ],
    "edges": [
      {"from": "coordinator", "to": "researcher"},
      {"from": "coordinator", "to": "analyst"},
      {"from": "coordinator", "to": "writer"}
    ]
  },
  "primitives": [
    {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "research-agent-id"},
    {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "analysis-agent-id"},
    {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "writing-agent-id"}
  },
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider adding a fact-check workflow after research",
    "Add error handling for routing failures"
  ]
}
```

## Network generation endpoint

For one-shot generation without an existing network, use `/agent/api/networks/generate`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Create a customer support network with technical support, billing support, and general support agents. The coordinator should route based on request content."
  }'
```

This endpoint:

- Lists all available agents, workflows, and tools
- Generates topology JSON based on your prompt
- Validates the generated topology
- Returns suggestions for improvements

### Example generation

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "I need a content creation pipeline: research → outline → draft → edit → publish. Each step should feed into the next."
  }'
```

**Generated topology**:

```json
{
  "topologyJson": {
    "nodes": [
      {"id": "research", "type": "agent", "label": "Research"},
      {"id": "outline", "type": "agent", "label": "Outline"},
      {"id": "draft", "type": "agent", "label": "Draft"},
      {"id": "edit", "type": "agent", "label": "Edit"},
      {"id": "publish", "type": "agent", "label": "Publish"}
    ],
    "edges": [
      {"from": "research", "to": "outline"},
      {"from": "outline", "to": "draft"},
      {"from": "draft", "to": "edit"},
      {"from": "edit", "to": "publish"}
    ]
  },
  "primitives": [
    {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "research-agent-id"},
    {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "outline-agent-id"},
    {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "draft-agent-id"},
    {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "edit-agent-id"},
    {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "publish-agent-id"}
  }
}
```

## Best practices

### Provide clear requirements

**Good prompts**:

- "Create a research network with coordinator routing to research, analysis, and writing agents"
- "Build a sequential pipeline: research → analysis → writing → editing"
- "Design a parallel market analysis network that analyzes competitors, trends, and feedback simultaneously"

**Vague prompts** (avoid):

- "Make a network"
- "I need agents"
- "Create something for research"

### Specify topology type

Mention the desired topology pattern:

- **Router**: "coordinator routes to specialists"
- **Sequential**: "pipeline", "chain", "step-by-step"
- **Parallel**: "simultaneously", "in parallel", "fan-out"

### Include context

Provide details about:

- **Number of agents**: "3-agent network"
- **Agent roles**: "research agent", "writing agent"
- **Execution flow**: "research feeds into analysis"
- **Special requirements**: "maintain context", "error handling"

## Iterative refinement

Use the designer chat for iterative refinement:

```bash
# Initial generation
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network/designer-chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Create a research network"
  }'

# Refine based on response
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network/designer-chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Add a fact-check workflow after research"
  }'

# Further refinement
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network/designer-chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Make the fact-check optional - only run if research confidence is low"
  }'
```

## Validation

The generated topology is automatically validated:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "topologyJson": {...},
  "primitives": [...],
  "validation": {
    "valid": true,
    "warnings": [],
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

**Validation checks**:

- All edge references point to valid nodes
- All primitive IDs exist
- No circular dependencies
- Coordinator exists for router topology

## Limitations

AI-assisted design has some limitations:

- **Primitive selection**: The system selects from existing agents/workflows. Create primitives first if they don't exist.
- **Complex topologies**: Very complex topologies may require manual refinement.
- **Custom logic**: Advanced routing logic (custom conditions, weights) may need manual configuration.

<Callout type="tip">
    Use AI-assisted design for initial topology generation, then manually refine complex routing
    logic and edge conditions.
</Callout>

## Complete example

Generate and deploy a complete network:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate topology
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Create a customer support network with technical, billing, and general support. Coordinator routes based on request content."
  }' > topology.json

# Step 2: Extract topology and primitives from response
TOPOLOGY=$(cat topology.json | jq -r '.topologyJson')
PRIMITIVES=$(cat topology.json | jq -r '.primitives')

# Step 3: Create network with generated topology
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"name\": \"Customer Support Network\",
    \"instructions\": \"You are a coordinator. Route technical questions to technical support, billing questions to billing support, and general inquiries to general support.\",
    \"modelProvider\": \"openai\",
    \"modelName\": \"gpt-4o\",
    \"topologyJson\": $TOPOLOGY,
    \"primitives\": $PRIMITIVES
  }"
```
