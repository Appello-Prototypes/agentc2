# Networks Overview

Networks are multi-agent topologies that coordinate multiple specialized agents and workflows through intelligent routing and delegation. They enable complex tasks that require multiple AI specializations by routing requests to the right agent based on context, confidence scores, and fallback strategies.

## What are networks?

A network in AgentC2 is a database-driven orchestration system that combines multiple agents, workflows, and tools into a coordinated execution graph. Networks use a routing agent (coordinator) that analyzes incoming requests and delegates to specialized primitives based on the task requirements, maintaining conversation context across the entire network execution.

Networks are stored in PostgreSQL and resolved at runtime, enabling version control, dynamic updates, and multi-tenant isolation without code deployments.

## When to use networks

Networks excel when your task requires:

- **Multiple specializations** — Different agents for research, writing, analysis, and execution
- **Sequential processing** — Pipeline workflows where output from one agent feeds into another
- **Parallel execution** — Fan-out/fan-in patterns where multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Intelligent routing** — Context-aware delegation based on request content and agent capabilities
- **Complex orchestration** — Multi-step operations that span multiple agents and workflows

<Callout type="info">
    **Networks vs Agents vs Workflows**: Use **agents** for single-agent conversational tasks. Use
    **workflows** for deterministic, step-by-step processes. Use **networks** to orchestrate
    multiple agents and workflows together with intelligent routing.
</Callout>

## Network model

Networks are defined by the following core fields stored in PostgreSQL:

| Field           | Type   | Description                                                       |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slug`          | string | Unique identifier (e.g., `"research-network"`)                    |
| `name`          | string | Display name                                                      |
| `instructions`  | string | System instructions for the routing coordinator agent             |
| `modelProvider` | string | LLM provider (`"openai"` or `"anthropic"`)                        |
| `modelName`     | string | Model identifier (e.g., `"gpt-4o"`, `"claude-sonnet-4-20250514"`) |
| `topologyJson`  | JSON   | Visual topology graph (`{nodes: [], edges: []}`)                  |
| `memoryConfig`  | JSON   | Memory configuration for network-wide context                     |
| `maxSteps`      | number | Maximum execution steps (default: 10)                             |

The `topologyJson` field defines the network structure:

```json
{
    "nodes": [
        { "id": "coordinator", "type": "agent", "label": "Router" },
        { "id": "researcher", "type": "agent", "label": "Research Agent" },
        { "id": "writer", "type": "agent", "label": "Writing Agent" }
    ],
    "edges": [
        { "from": "coordinator", "to": "researcher", "condition": "research_task" },
        { "from": "coordinator", "to": "writer", "condition": "writing_task" }
    ]
}
```

## Network lifecycle

Every network follows a predictable lifecycle:

### 1. Design

Define the network topology and select primitives (agents, workflows, tools):

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Research Network",
    "slug": "research-network",
    "instructions": "You are a coordinator. Route research tasks to the research agent, writing tasks to the writer agent.",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "topologyJson": {
      "nodes": [
        {"id": "coordinator", "type": "agent"},
        {"id": "researcher", "type": "agent"},
        {"id": "writer", "type": "agent"}
      ],
      "edges": [
        {"from": "coordinator", "to": "researcher"},
        {"from": "coordinator", "to": "writer"}
      ]
    },
    "primitives": [
      {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "research-agent-id"},
      {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "writing-agent-id"}
    ],
    "memoryConfig": {
      "lastMessages": 20,
      "semanticRecall": {"topK": 3}
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Configure

Attach primitives, define routing logic, and configure memory:

```bash
# Update network with additional primitives
curl -X PUT https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "primitives": [
      {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "research-agent-id", "description": "Handles research queries"},
      {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "writing-agent-id", "description": "Creates written content"},
      {"primitiveType": "workflow", "workflowId": "fact-check-workflow-id"}
    ]
  }'
```

### 3. Test

Execute test runs and validate routing behavior:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Research the latest AI developments and write a summary",
    "threadId": "test-thread-123"
  }'
```

### 4. Version

Create snapshots before making changes:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network/versions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Added fact-check workflow to research pipeline"
  }'
```

### 5. Deploy

Publish the network for production use:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "isPublished": true,
    "isActive": true
  }'
```

### 6. Monitor

Track execution metrics and routing decisions:

```bash
# List network runs
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network/runs?limit=10 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# View network metrics
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-network/metrics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Simple example

Create a minimal 3-agent research network:

```bash
# Step 1: Create the network
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Research Pipeline",
    "instructions": "You coordinate research tasks. Route web research to the researcher, analysis to the analyst, and writing to the writer.",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "modelName": "gpt-4o",
    "topologyJson": {
      "nodes": [
        {"id": "coordinator", "type": "agent", "label": "Coordinator"},
        {"id": "researcher", "type": "agent", "label": "Researcher"},
        {"id": "analyst", "type": "agent", "label": "Analyst"},
        {"id": "writer", "type": "agent", "label": "Writer"}
      ],
      "edges": [
        {"from": "coordinator", "to": "researcher"},
        {"from": "coordinator", "to": "analyst"},
        {"from": "coordinator", "to": "writer"}
      ]
    },
    "primitives": [
      {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "research-agent-id"},
      {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "analysis-agent-id"},
      {"primitiveType": "agent", "agentId": "writing-agent-id"}
    ],
    "memoryConfig": {"lastMessages": 30}
  }'

# Step 2: Execute a research task
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/networks/research-pipeline/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Research quantum computing breakthroughs in 2025 and write an analysis report",
    "threadId": "research-thread-456"
  }'
```

The coordinator analyzes the request, routes web research to the researcher, analysis to the analyst, and final writing to the writer, maintaining context across all steps.

## Network types

Networks can be one of two types:

- **USER** — Created by users, stored in your workspace, fully customizable
- **SYSTEM** — Platform-provided networks with default configurations

Most networks you create are **USER** type. They're isolated to your workspace and organization, ensuring data privacy and multi-tenant security.
