# Connect from Claude

Claude clients (CoWork, Desktop, and Code) support remote MCP servers over Streamable HTTP, so they connect directly to the AgentC2 MCP endpoint without a local proxy script. This guide covers setup for all three clients.

## Prerequisites

- An AgentC2 API key and organization slug ([generate one](/docs/mcp/getting-started))
- One of: Claude CoWork, Claude Desktop, or Claude Code

## Claude CoWork

Claude CoWork supports remote MCP connectors with OAuth authentication built in.

### Step 1: Open Connectors

In Claude CoWork, navigate to **Connectors** (or **Integrations**, depending on your version) in the sidebar or settings menu.

### Step 2: Add a custom connector

Click **Add Custom Connector** and fill in the following:

| Field                   | Value                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                | AgentC2                                                   |
| **Remote MCP URL**      | `https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/server/{your-org-slug}` |
| **OAuth Client ID**     | `{your-org-slug}`                                         |
| **OAuth Client Secret** | `{your-api-key}`                                          |

Replace `{your-org-slug}` with your organization slug and `{your-api-key}` with your MCP API key.

### Step 3: Connect

Click **Connect**. The OAuth flow auto-approves — there is no manual consent screen. Once connected, AgentC2's 202 tools appear in Claude's tool list.

### Step 4: Verify

Start a new conversation and ask:

> "What MCP tools do you have available?"

Claude should list tools across agent management, workflows, networks, knowledge, skills, integrations, and org management.

<Callout type="tip">
    Claude CoWork may group MCP tools under the connector name. Look for "AgentC2" in the tools
    panel to see all available tools.
</Callout>

## Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop supports remote MCP servers via its configuration file.

### Step 1: Locate the config file

The Claude Desktop configuration file is at:

| OS          | Path                                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**   | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`                     |
| **Linux**   | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`                     |

Create the file if it doesn't exist.

### Step 2: Add the MCP server

Add the AgentC2 server to the `mcpServers` object:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "AgentC2": {
            "url": "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/server/{your-org-slug}",
            "oauth": {
                "client_id": "{your-org-slug}",
                "client_secret": "{your-api-key}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace the placeholders with your organization slug and API key.

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

Quit and reopen Claude Desktop. It reads the MCP configuration on startup and connects to configured servers.

### Step 4: Verify

Open a new conversation and ask:

> "List all agents in my AgentC2 workspace"

Claude should call the `agent_discover` tool and return your agents.

## Claude Code

Claude Code (the CLI tool) supports remote MCP server configuration.

### Step 1: Add the MCP server

Use the Claude Code settings command to add the AgentC2 MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add AgentC2 \
  --transport http \
  --url "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/server/{your-org-slug}" \
  --oauth-client-id "{your-org-slug}" \
  --oauth-client-secret "{your-api-key}"
```

Or add it manually to your Claude Code MCP configuration file (location depends on your Claude Code version — check `claude mcp list` for the config path).

### Step 2: Verify

Start a new Claude Code session and ask:

> "What MCP tools do you have available?"

You should see the full set of AgentC2 tools.

<Callout type="info">
    Claude Code's MCP configuration persists across sessions. You only need to configure the server
    once.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth errors across all clients

**Symptom**: Connection fails with authentication or OAuth errors.

- Verify your API key has not been regenerated since you configured the client
- The `client_id` must exactly match your organization slug (case-sensitive)
- The `client_secret` is your MCP API key, not your session token or password

### Tools don't appear after connecting

- Some Claude clients cache the tool list. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the MCP server
- Verify the URL includes the `/agent` path prefix and your org slug: `https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/server/{slug}`
- Check that your organization has active agents, workflows, or other resources — tools are always available regardless of resource count, but it helps confirm connectivity

### "Transport not supported" error

- Ensure your Claude client version supports Streamable HTTP (MCP spec 2025-03-26)
- Claude Desktop versions before January 2026 may not support remote MCP — update to the latest version

### Rate limiting

The AgentC2 MCP server applies standard rate limits. If you hit rate limits during heavy automation:

- Space out tool calls in your prompts
- Use batch-style prompts that achieve more in fewer tool invocations
- Contact your organization admin to review rate limit settings
