# MCP Quick Start

This guide walks you through generating an API key and connecting to the AgentC2 MCP server. You'll have tools available in your AI assistant in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- An AgentC2 account with at least one workspace
- One of: Cursor IDE, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or Claude CoWork

## Step 1: Log in to your workspace

Open [agentc2.ai](https://agentc2.ai) and log in. Navigate to any workspace where you have admin or member access.

## Step 2: Open the Integrations Hub

Go to the **Integrations** page in your workspace sidebar, or navigate directly to `/workspace/integrations`. This page lists all available integration providers and active connections.

Look for the **Organization MCP Access** section at the top of the page. This section shows your organization's MCP endpoint and API key status.

## Step 3: Generate an API key

In the Organization MCP Access section:

1. Click **Generate** to create a new MCP API key
2. Copy the generated key immediately — it is only shown once
3. Note your **organization slug** displayed in the same section (e.g., `my-company`)

Your MCP endpoint is:

```
https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/server/{your-org-slug}
```

<Callout type="warning">
    Store your API key securely. It grants full access to your organization's AgentC2 workspace via
    MCP tools. If compromised, regenerate it immediately from the same Integrations Hub page.
</Callout>

### API alternative

You can also generate keys programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/organizations/{orgId}/mcp-api-key \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This requires an authenticated session (cookie-based auth from the AgentC2 web app). The response includes the API key and organization slug.

## Step 4: Note your credentials

You need two values for client configuration:

| Value                 | Where to find it                     | Example            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Organization slug** | Integrations Hub, MCP Access section | `my-company`       |
| **MCP API key**       | Generated in Step 3                  | `mcp_k1_abc123...` |

## Step 5: Choose your client

Follow the setup guide for your preferred client:

- **[Cursor IDE](/docs/mcp/cursor-setup)** — Uses a local Node.js proxy script that translates stdio to the AgentC2 API
- **[Claude CoWork / Claude Desktop / Claude Code](/docs/mcp/claude-setup)** — Connects directly via remote Streamable HTTP

## Step 6: Verify the connection

Once configured, test the connection by asking your AI assistant:

> "What MCP tools do you have available?"

Your assistant should list tools across agent management, workflow management, network management, knowledge/RAG, skill management, integration management, and organization management. If you see 200+ tools, you're connected.

### Quick verification commands

Try these to confirm everything works:

> "List all agents in my workspace"

This calls the `agent_discover` tool and returns your configured agents.

> "Show my organization's workspaces"

This calls `org_workspaces_list` and confirms organization-scoped access.

## Troubleshooting

### No tools appear

- Verify your API key is correct and has not been regenerated since you configured the client
- Check that your organization slug matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure the MCP server URL includes the `/agent` path prefix: `https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/mcp/server/{slug}`

### Authentication errors

- API keys are organization-scoped. If you switched organizations, generate a new key for the target org
- For the API endpoint, ensure you're using session auth (cookie), not the MCP API key

### Connection timeout

- The AgentC2 MCP server uses Streamable HTTP. Ensure your client supports this transport
- For Cursor, verify Node.js is installed and the proxy script path is correct
