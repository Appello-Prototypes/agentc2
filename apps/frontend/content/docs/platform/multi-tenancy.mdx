# Multi-Tenancy

AgentC2 is built as a multi-tenant platform where organizations own workspaces, workspaces contain agents and resources, and membership controls access with role-based permissions. Tenant isolation ensures data privacy, security boundaries, and resource quotas across all platform operations.

## Architecture overview

The multi-tenant model follows a hierarchical structure:

```
Organization (tenant boundary)
  ├── Workspace (environment isolation)
  │     ├── Agents
  │     ├── Workflows
  │     ├── Networks
  │     ├── Documents
  │     └── Integrations
  └── Membership (user access control)
```

### Organization model

Organizations are the top-level tenant boundary. Each organization:

- **Owns resources** — All agents, workspaces, documents, and integrations belong to an organization
- **Enforces quotas** — Limits on agents, workspaces, runs per month, seats, and storage
- **Manages billing** — Stripe customer ID for subscription management
- **Tracks lifecycle** — Status (active, trial, suspended, past_due), trial expiration, suspension reasons

```bash
# Create an organization
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/organizations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "slug": "acme-corp",
    "description": "Enterprise AI automation"
  }'
```

### Workspace model

Workspaces provide environment isolation within an organization. Each workspace:

- **Isolates resources** — Agents, workflows, and documents are scoped to a workspace
- **Supports environments** — `development`, `staging`, `production` environments
- **Has a default** — One workspace per organization marked as `isDefault`
- **Maintains metadata** — Custom JSON metadata for workspace-specific configuration

```bash
# Create a workspace
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organizationId": "org_123",
    "name": "Production",
    "slug": "prod",
    "environment": "production"
  }'
```

<Callout type="info">
    **Workspace vs Organization**: Use **organizations** for tenant boundaries (billing, quotas,
    isolation). Use **workspaces** for environment separation (dev/staging/prod) within a single
    organization.
</Callout>

## Tenant isolation boundaries

All platform operations enforce tenant isolation at the database level:

### Data isolation

| Resource Type    | Isolation Boundary                           | Query Pattern                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Agents**       | `workspaceId` → `organizationId`             | Filter by workspace, verify org membership |
| **Documents**    | `workspaceId` → `organizationId`             | RAG queries scoped to workspace            |
| **Runs**         | `agentId` → `workspaceId` → `organizationId` | Traces isolated per tenant                 |
| **Integrations** | `organizationId`                             | OAuth tokens encrypted per org             |
| **Schedules**    | `workspaceId` → `organizationId`             | Cron jobs scoped to workspace              |

### API-level enforcement

Every API request validates tenant boundaries. The platform's authentication middleware automatically verifies that the requesting user belongs to the organization that owns the requested resource. If a user attempts to access an agent, document, or integration outside their organization, the request is rejected.

### Cross-workspace assumptions

While workspaces provide isolation, some resources can be shared:

- **Skills** — Can be attached to agents across workspaces (within same org)
- **Tool Credentials** — Organization-level MCP credentials shared across workspaces
- **Integrations** — OAuth connections scoped to organization, usable in any workspace

<Callout type="warning">
    **Never assume cross-tenant access**: Always verify `organizationId` matches the authenticated
    user's organization. Database queries should include tenant filters to prevent data leakage.
</Callout>

## Membership and roles

The `Membership` model controls user access to organizations:

### Role hierarchy

| Role       | Permissions                        | Use Case                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **owner**  | Full control, billing, deletion    | Organization creator         |
| **admin**  | Manage members, workspaces, agents | Team leads, technical admins |
| **member** | Create/edit agents, run workflows  | Regular users                |
| **viewer** | Read-only access                   | Auditors, stakeholders       |

### Granular permissions

Beyond roles, `permissions` array supports fine-grained access:

```json
{
    "role": "member",
    "permissions": ["guardrail_override", "budget_override", "integration_manage"]
}
```

### Membership lifecycle

```bash
# Invite a user to an organization
curl -X POST https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/organizations/acme-corp/members \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "member",
    "permissions": []
  }'

# Update membership role
curl -X PATCH https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/memberships/mem_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```

## Admin control surfaces

Platform administrators can manage organizations via admin APIs:

### Organization management

- **Suspend organizations** — Set `status: "suspended"` with reason
- **Adjust quotas** — Override `maxAgents`, `maxWorkspaces`, `maxRunsPerMonth`
- **Monitor health** — Track `riskScore`, `lastHealthCheck`
- **Billing control** — Link Stripe customer, manage subscriptions

### Workspace management

- **Create workspaces** — Provision new environments
- **Set defaults** — Mark workspace as `isDefault`
- **Environment control** — Enforce environment naming conventions

### Membership management

- **Invite users** — Generate invite codes with expiration
- **Domain-based join** — Auto-join via `OrganizationDomain` mapping
- **Role assignment** — Assign roles and granular permissions

## Key properties

### Organizations

Each organization has a unique slug, a display name, and a lifecycle status (`active`, `trial`, `suspended`, `past_due`, or `deactivated`). Organizations also carry configurable quotas for agents, workspaces, monthly runs, user seats, and storage.

### Workspaces

Workspaces belong to an organization and are identified by a slug (unique within the org). Each workspace is assigned an environment (`development`, `staging`, or `production`) and one workspace per organization is marked as the default.

### Memberships

A membership links a user to an organization with a role (`owner`, `admin`, `member`, or `viewer`) and an optional list of granular permissions for fine-grained access control.

## Best practices

1. **Use workspaces for environments** — Separate dev/staging/prod into different workspaces
2. **Enforce quotas** — Set `maxAgents`, `maxRunsPerMonth` to prevent runaway usage
3. **Role-based access** — Assign minimal permissions; use `viewer` for read-only access
4. **Monitor health** — Track `riskScore` and `lastHealthCheck` for tenant health
5. **Soft delete** — Use `deletedAt` for soft deletion, preserve audit trails
