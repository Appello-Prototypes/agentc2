# Observability

AgentC2 provides comprehensive observability through agent run traces, step-by-step execution logs, aggregate metrics, cost dashboards, and health scoring. Every agent run generates a complete trace with LLM calls, tool executions, memory operations, and guardrail checks, enabling debugging, performance analysis, and compliance auditing.

## Run traces

Every agent execution creates a **trace** that captures the complete execution context, including the input, output, model configuration, token usage, evaluation scores, duration, and status (`RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`).

### Trace steps

Each trace contains a sequence of **steps** representing the individual operations the agent performed. Steps are ordered by execution sequence and each records its type, content, timestamp, and duration.

### Step types

| Step Type     | Description                     | Content Structure                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **llm**       | LLM call (prompt + response)    | `{ prompt, response, model, tokens }`      |
| **tool**      | Tool execution                  | `{ toolKey, input, output, durationMs }`   |
| **memory**    | Memory operation (recall/store) | `{ operation, query, results }`            |
| **guardrail** | Guardrail check                 | `{ guardrailId, passed, blocked, reason }` |

## Querying traces

Traces can be queried via the REST API with filters for status, date range, and agent:

```bash
# List traces for an agent
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/traces?limit=50 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get specific trace with all steps
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/traces/trace_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Query with filters
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/traces?status=FAILED&startDate=2026-02-01&endDate=2026-02-18" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Filter traces that include tool calls
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/traces?stepType=tool&agentSlug=research-assistant" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Aggregate metrics

The platform aggregates metrics across runs for dashboards and analytics:

### Cost metrics

- **Total tokens** — Sum of input and output tokens across all runs
- **Total cost** — Estimated cost in USD based on token usage and model rates
- **Average latency** — Mean response time per run
- **P95 latency** — 95th percentile response time (useful for SLA monitoring)

### Quality metrics

- **Average quality score** — Mean evaluation score across runs
- **Failure rate** — Percentage of runs that ended with an error
- **Guardrail blocks** — Number of outputs blocked by guardrail policies

### Usage metrics

- **Runs per day** — Daily run volume, useful for capacity planning
- **Active agents** — Number of distinct agents with runs in the selected period
- **Tool usage** — Breakdown of which tools are called most frequently

### Querying metrics via API

```bash
# Get daily cost breakdown for an agent (last 30 days)
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/metrics/cost?period=30d" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get tool usage statistics
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/metrics/tools?period=30d" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Cost dashboards

Cost dashboards provide real-time visibility into spending:

### Organization-level costs

```bash
# Get organization costs
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/organizations/acme-corp/metrics/cost \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Response
{
  "period": "2026-02",
  "totalCost": 1234.56,
  "totalTokens": 123456789,
  "byAgent": [
    { "agentId": "agent_1", "cost": 567.89, "tokens": 56789012 },
    { "agentId": "agent_2", "cost": 666.67, "tokens": 66667877 }
  ],
  "byModel": [
    { "model": "gpt-4o", "cost": 1000.00 },
    { "model": "claude-sonnet-4", "cost": 234.56 }
  ]
}
```

### Budget alerts

Organizations can set budget thresholds to receive notifications before spending limits are reached:

```bash
# Set monthly budget and alert threshold
curl -X PATCH https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/organizations/acme-corp/budget \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "monthlyLimit": 10000,
    "alertThreshold": 0.8,
    "alertEmail": "admin@acme.com"
  }'
```

When budget thresholds are exceeded, the platform:

1. **Logs alert** — Creates `BudgetAlert` record
2. **Sends notification** — Emails alert recipients
3. **Enforces limits** — Blocks new runs if `enforceLimit: true`

<Callout type="warning">
    **Budget enforcement**: When `enforceLimit: true` and budget is exceeded, all agent runs are
    blocked until the budget is increased or the period resets.
</Callout>

## Health scores

Organizations receive health scores based on multiple factors:

### Health score calculation

Health scores are computed on a 0–100 scale from five weighted factors:

- **Reliability (30%)** — Based on failure rate across agent runs
- **Performance (20%)** — Based on P95 latency
- **Quality (20%)** — Based on average evaluation scores
- **Security (15%)** — Based on security incident frequency
- **Compliance (15%)** — Based on guardrail violation rate

The overall score is a weighted average of these factors.

### Health score thresholds

| Score Range | Status        | Action                       |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 90-100      | **Excellent** | No action needed             |
| 70-89       | **Good**      | Monitor trends               |
| 50-69       | **Fair**      | Review metrics, optimize     |
| 0-49        | **Poor**      | Immediate attention required |

### Health check API

```bash
# Get organization health score
curl https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/organizations/acme-corp/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Response
{
  "score": 87,
  "status": "good",
  "factors": {
    "reliability": 92,
    "performance": 85,
    "quality": 88,
    "security": 90,
    "compliance": 82
  },
  "lastUpdated": "2026-02-18T12:00:00Z",
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider optimizing agent latency (P95: 3.2s)",
    "Review guardrail violations (5 in last 7 days)"
  ]
}
```

## Alert thresholds

Configure alert thresholds for proactive monitoring:

### Alert configuration

```bash
# Configure alert thresholds for an organization
curl -X PATCH https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/organizations/acme-corp/alerts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "failureRate": { "threshold": 0.05, "enabled": true },
    "latencyP95": { "threshold": 5000, "enabled": true },
    "costSpike": { "threshold": 1.5, "enabled": true },
    "qualityDrop": { "threshold": 0.1, "enabled": true }
  }'
```

### Alert delivery

Alerts are delivered via:

- **Email** — Sent to organization admins
- **Webhook** — POST to configured webhook URL
- **Slack** — Posted to Slack channel (if configured)

## Debugging with traces

Traces provide complete execution context for debugging:

### Common debugging scenarios

#### 1. Failed runs

Retrieve failed traces to inspect the error. The last step in the trace typically contains the error message and context.

```bash
# Get recent failed traces
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/traces?status=FAILED&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### 2. Slow runs

Filter traces by minimum duration to find slow runs, then inspect step-level durations to identify bottlenecks (e.g., a slow tool call or a large LLM response).

```bash
# Get the 10 slowest traces from the last 7 days
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/traces?minDurationMs=5000&sort=durationMs:desc&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### 3. Tool execution issues

Filter for traces that contain tool-type steps with errors. The response includes the tool key, input, and error details so you can identify patterns across failures.

```bash
# Get traces with tool failures
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/traces?stepType=tool&hasErrors=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### 4. Guardrail violations

Query for traces where a guardrail step blocked the output. Each result includes the guardrail ID, the reason for blocking, and the original input.

```bash
# Get traces with guardrail blocks
curl "https://agentc2.ai/agent/api/agents/research-assistant/traces?stepType=guardrail&blocked=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Monitoring guidance

### Key metrics to monitor

1. **Failure rate** — Should be under 5% for production agents
2. **P95 latency** — Should be under 3s for conversational agents
3. **Cost per run** — Track trends, alert on spikes
4. **Quality scores** — Should maintain >0.8 average
5. **Token usage** — Monitor for efficiency improvements

### Dashboard setup

Create dashboards for:

- **Real-time metrics** — Current run status, active agents
- **Cost tracking** — Daily/weekly/monthly spend by agent/model
- **Quality trends** — Evaluation scores over time
- **Performance** — Latency percentiles, throughput
- **Reliability** — Failure rates, error patterns

### Alerting best practices

1. **Set realistic thresholds** — Base on historical data, not arbitrary values
2. **Avoid alert fatigue** — Only alert on actionable issues
3. **Use multiple channels** — Email for critical, Slack for informational
4. **Review regularly** — Adjust thresholds based on false positives
5. **Document runbooks** — Include remediation steps in alerts
