## Linking Rules

- Link to one cornerstone page.
- Link to one sibling page in the same section.
- Link to one conversion page (`/signup` or `/workspace`).

## Accuracy Rules

- Every technical claim must map to implemented product behavior.
- Prefer explicit names used in platform UI and API.
- Avoid speculative capability language.
