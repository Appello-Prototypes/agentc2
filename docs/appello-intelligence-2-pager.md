### YOU KNOW YOUR BUSINESS. BUT DO YOU KNOW IT BEFORE 7 AM?

Right now, your dispatcher spends the first hour every morning figuring out today's problems. Your payroll person spends every Monday chasing missing timesheets. Your project manager finds out a job lost money _after_ the job is done. Your safety manager reviews hundreds of JHAs but can't see the patterns.

The data is in Appello. The intelligence isn't — yet.

### APPELLO INTELLIGENCE: YOUR DATA, WORKING FOR YOU — BEFORE YOU GET TO THE OFFICE

Appello Intelligence is the AI layer on top of your Appello platform. It reads your scheduling, timesheets, safety forms, job costs, certifications, and equipment data — then delivers the insights that matter, automatically, every day.

**No new software to learn. No dashboards to check. No reports to run.** Intelligence delivers what you need to know straight to your Slack channel or email inbox — before your team gets to the office.

### WHO IT'S FOR

| Role                         | What Intelligence Does For You                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner / GM**               | Know how the business is doing before your morning coffee. Catch job overruns weeks early. See the whole picture weekly without pulling reports.   |
| **Dispatcher / Ops Manager** | Start your day with conflicts already identified and solutions suggested. No more whiteboard detective work.                                       |
| **Payroll / Admin**          | Monday payroll prep goes from 3-4 hours to 30 minutes. Missing timesheets are caught daily, not discovered on payday.                              |
| **Safety Manager**           | See trends across hundreds of safety forms that no human has time to read. Get alerts before a cert expires — not after a worker shows up to site. |
| **Project Manager**          | Know which jobs are bleeding money while there's still time to fix it. Progress billing prep cut by 70%.                                           |
| **Estimating**               | Never forget to follow up on a quote. See which estimates are going cold and which are hot.                                                        |

### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Does this change how we use Appello?**
No. Intelligence reads your data — it doesn't change your workflow. Your team uses Appello exactly the same way. You just get smarter insights delivered automatically.

**Is our data safe?**
Intelligence reads your Appello data through a secure, encrypted connection. Your data never leaves your Appello instance. No data is shared with other customers. AES-256 encryption for all credentials.

**What if the AI gets something wrong?**
Intelligence is read-only in Starter and Pro — it reports, it doesn't change anything. You always make the final call. Enterprise tier includes write actions (like creating notes) with human approval required.

**How long does setup take?**
One onboarding call. We connect your instance, activate playbooks, choose delivery (Slack or email), and test. Most customers see their first Intelligence briefing within 48 hours.

**Can I customize the playbooks?**
Pro and Enterprise tiers include custom alert thresholds (e.g., "alert me when a job exceeds 110% of budget" vs. the default 100%). Enterprise includes fully custom playbooks built for your specific operations.

**What does it actually cost to run?**
Our AI costs average $5-10/month per customer. The pricing ($250-1,000/month) includes the AI costs, platform, support, and ongoing improvements. You will never see a surprise bill.
