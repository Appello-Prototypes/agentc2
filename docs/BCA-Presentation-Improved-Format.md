# BCA Lunch & Learn "AI in Construction" -- Improved Presentation Plan

**Goal:** Take the presentation from 7.5/10 to 10/10.

**Target Runtime:** 44 minutes presentation + 14 minutes Q&A/discussion = 58 minutes total.

This document is organized by improvement category, with exact placement timestamps and scripted inserts. The final section contains the complete revised outline.

---

## 1. ENGAGEMENT & INTERACTION (4/10 --> 9/10)

This is the single biggest gap. The original presentation was a 56-minute monologue. Here are five interaction points to weave in.

---

### Insert #1 -- Opening Poll

**Placement:** 00:00:39, right after "thanks everyone for joining"

Before launching into your personal story, ask the audience a direct question:

> _"Before I get started, quick show of hands -- how many of you have used ChatGPT or any AI tool in the last 30 days? ... How about in your business specifically? ... Okay, great. By the end of this session, I want every single hand in this room to go up."_

**Why it works:** Gauges the room, creates a baseline you can reference later, and sets a measurable goal for the talk.

---

### Insert #2 -- Reflection Prompt

**Placement:** 00:09:50, right after "I know where I was" re: ChatGPT launch

You say "I don't know if you know where you were, but I know where I was." Turn this into an actual moment:

> _"Take five seconds -- do you remember where you were when you first tried ChatGPT? If you haven't tried it yet, that's okay too. But I want you to hold that thought, because by the end of this talk, I'm going to show you exactly where to start."_

**Why it works:** Creates a personal anchor point and re-engages anyone who is drifting during the historical timeline.

---

### Insert #3 -- Mid-Talk Check-In

**Placement:** 00:26:27, when introducing MCP

MCP is the most technical concept in the talk. Before explaining it, pause and calibrate:

> _"Alright, I'm about to introduce a concept that I think is the most important term you'll hear today. Before I do -- is everyone still with me? Thumbs up if the AI history section made sense. Good. This next part is where it gets really practical for your business."_

**Why it works:** Signals "the good stuff is coming" and re-captures attention at the 26-minute mark, which is exactly where attention typically drops.

---

### Insert #4 -- Audience Exercise

**Placement:** 00:45:44, after showing the 68-point integration map

You say "I did some analysis" and show the map. Instead of just presenting it, make it interactive:

> _"I want you to think about your business for 30 seconds. Of those 68 integration points, pick just ONE. One repetitive task that you or someone on your team does every single day that you wish you didn't have to. Got it? Hold onto that. That's your first AI agent."_

**Why it works:** Transforms a passive slide into a personal insight moment. Also seeds the Q&A.

---

### Insert #5 -- Q&A Seeding

**Placement:** 00:55:36, before opening Q&A

Never open with "any questions?" to silence. Instead:

> _"I'll take questions in a moment, but first -- remember that one repetitive task I asked you to think about? I'd love to hear a couple. Who wants to share theirs? I'll tell you right now whether an AI agent could handle it today, or if it's a 2027 problem."_

**Why it works:** Converts Q&A from "questions for the expert" into "let's workshop your problem together," which is far less intimidating and far more valuable.

---

## 2. PACING & TIME MANAGEMENT (6.5/10 --> 9/10)

The historical timeline (00:04:59 to 00:13:00) runs ~8 minutes and the year-by-year section (00:13:00 to 00:30:00) runs ~17 minutes. That's 25 minutes of history before the audience hears a single construction use case. Restructure as follows.

---

### Cut: Condense the 2012-2022 Timeline

**Location:** 00:09:16 to 00:09:47

You list "a whole bunch of major breakthroughs" over 10 years. Instead of walking through each one, consolidate into a single sentence:

> _"Between 2012 and 2022, there were a dozen major breakthroughs, each building on the last. I've listed them on this slide for you to review later. The one that matters most is this: the Transformer architecture in 2017."_

**Saves:** ~2 minutes.

---

### Cut: Shorten the 2023 Year-in-Review

**Location:** 00:12:00 to 00:13:20

The month-by-month 2023 recap (GPT-4 in March, Code Interpreter in June, Voice in September, Google Gemini in December) is detailed but slow. Compress to:

> _"2023 was the year AI proved it was real. GPT-4 arrived in March with image understanding. By December, Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI were in a full arms race. In one year, we saw as many breakthroughs as the prior decade combined."_

**Saves:** ~90 seconds.

---

### Cut: Shorten the AlphaFold Video Segment

**Location:** 00:14:24 to 00:18:00

The documentary clip runs ~3.5 minutes. Trim to the 90-second emotional core: the moment they decide to fold every protein in existence and release it to the world. Cut the setup and the extended celebration footage.

**Saves:** ~2 minutes.

---

### Reallocate: Add 5 Minutes to Construction Use Cases

**Location:** Expand 00:43:30 to 00:48:00

With ~6 minutes reclaimed, invest them here. Currently the RFI, change order, and site report use cases each get ~30 seconds. Expand each one:

- **RFI Processing (currently 00:44:06):** Walk through a real RFI example. _"Last week, we had an RFI come in from a subtrade. Here's what happened step by step..."_

- **Change Order Automation (currently 00:45:00):** Show the cost savings. _"A change order that used to take a PM 2 hours to draft -- contract review, cost estimation, document generation -- now takes 8 minutes with a human review."_

- **Daily Site Report (currently 00:43:49):** Show a before/after. Display a raw field report on one slide and the AI-generated executive summary on the next.

**Target Runtime:** 42-45 minutes presentation + 12-15 minutes Q&A/discussion.

---

## 3. LIVE DEMOS (6.5/10 --> 9/10)

---

### Fix #1: Pre-configure All Demos

The Claude demo hit friction ("it's kind of a pain to get these tools set up" at 00:42:00). Before the next presentation:

- [ ] Have Claude desktop pre-configured with HubSpot and Jira MCP servers already connected
- [ ] Have a ChatGPT session pre-loaded with the HubSpot app activated
- [ ] Record a 60-second backup video of each demo in case of live failure

---

### Fix #2: Replace the Claude Setup Demo with a Claude Results Demo

**Location:** 00:39:34 to 00:42:37

Instead of showing the audience how painful setup is, show them a pre-configured Claude session doing something impressive:

> _"I've already got Claude connected to our CRM, our project management tool, and our calendar. Watch this -- I'm going to ask it: 'What are the three highest-priority support tickets this week, and draft a response to the most urgent one.' ... And there it is. It pulled live data from HubSpot, analyzed priority, and drafted a professional response in 12 seconds."_

---

### Fix #3: Add One Construction-Specific Demo

**Placement:** Insert at ~00:44:00

Neither original demo was construction-specific. Add one that is:

> _"Now let me show you something closer to home. I'm going to ask Claude: 'Summarize all the meeting notes from the last week and list any action items that mention safety or schedule delays.' Watch what happens..."_

**Why it works:** Connects the abstract "AI + tools" concept directly to the audience's daily reality.

---

## 4. PROFESSIONALISM & DELIVERY (7.5/10 --> 9.5/10)

---

### Fix #1: Eliminate the Waiting Room Problem

**Location:** 00:14:30

- [ ] Assign a co-host (e.g., Bryony or Alison from BCA) to manage the Zoom waiting room
- [ ] If presenting solo, set Zoom to auto-admit participants

The 14-minute delay and mid-presentation interruption ("I'm going to admit all of these people who are waiting, and I'm so sorry") was avoidable.

---

### Fix #2: Soften the Product Pitch

**Location:** 00:54:35 to 00:55:35

**Replace this:**

> "We're rolling these types of agentic systems into Appello... we'll be releasing Appello Intelligence..."

**With this:**

> _"At Appello, we're one of many companies trying to make this accessible for construction. The software you already use -- whether it's Procore, Sage, or something else -- will be building these same capabilities. The important thing is that YOU start preparing your data and your processes now, so when these tools arrive, you can take advantage of them on day one."_

**Why it works:** Positions you as a thought leader, not a salesperson. Makes the BCA more likely to invite you back.

---

### Fix #3: Audio Quality

Several transcript segments were garbled ("titicLine", "Только mijnhoegsito"). For the next presentation:

- [ ] Use a dedicated USB microphone or headset rather than a laptop mic
- [ ] Test audio levels with a co-host before the session starts
- [ ] If presenting in-person with a Zoom hybrid setup, ensure the room mic captures clearly

---

### Fix #4: Close with a Memorable Line

**Location:** Replace 00:55:36 ("I hope everybody found this to be informative")

**New closing:**

> _"Four years ago, AI could barely write a coherent paragraph. Today it's winning Nobel Prizes and writing production-quality software. Four years from now, it will be managing RFIs, drafting change orders, and catching safety issues before they happen. The question isn't whether this is coming to construction -- it's whether you'll be ready when it does. Start experimenting today. Thank you."_

---

## 5. CONTENT QUALITY (8.5/10 --> 10/10)

---

### Fix #1: Correct "Nobel Peace Prize"

**Location:** 00:19:01

You said "Nobel Peace Prize" -- it was the **Nobel Prize in Chemistry**. Small factual error but easy to fix and matters for credibility with any technically-minded attendees.

---

### Fix #2: Add a "Skeptic's Slide"

**Placement:** Insert after 00:35:00, after the 2026 current state section

Before diving into use cases, acknowledge the elephant in the room:

> _"Now, I know some of you are thinking: 'This sounds great, but AI hallucinates. It makes things up. How can I trust it with my business?' Fair question. Here's the answer: you don't trust it blindly. Every workflow I'm about to show you has a human-in-the-loop. The AI moves first, but a human reviews and approves. Think of it like a junior estimator -- they do the first draft, you check their work. That's exactly how these agents operate."_

**Why it works:** Preemptively handles the #1 objection and increases credibility.

---

### Fix #3: Add One ROI Number

**Placement:** Insert at ~00:44:00

The talk is missing a single hard ROI figure. Add one:

> _"At Appello, our post-meeting email workflow used to take 10-15 minutes per meeting. With Fathom + AI, it takes one minute. We do 8-10 meetings a day. That's saving us roughly 80-120 minutes of admin time every single day. Over a year, that's an entire full-time employee's worth of time -- recovered."_

**Why it works:** Construction audiences respond to numbers. One concrete ROI calculation makes the entire talk more credible.
