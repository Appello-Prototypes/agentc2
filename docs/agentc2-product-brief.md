# AgentC2 — Product Brief

_Executive summary for sales enablement, partner conversations, and strategic planning_

---

## In One Sentence

AgentC2 deploys autonomous AI across the tools a business already uses — and measures exactly what it saves.

---

## Target Market

**Primary:** Mid-market companies (50-500 employees) with 5+ SaaS tools and operational pain from manual cross-tool work. Decision maker is a VP or Director of Sales, Operations, Support, or Engineering.

**Secondary:** Small businesses (5-50) using self-serve, and enterprises (500+) through sales-assisted deals.

**Vertical wedge:** ICI subcontractors (20-200 field staff) already using Appello, entering through Appello Intelligence.

**Market size:** The AI agent platform market is valued at $8-11B in 2026, growing at 40-45% CAGR. 62% of organizations are experimenting, but only 2% have scaled deployment — the trust cliff that AgentC2's governance layer is built to cross.

## Value Proposition

**For the buyer:** "Stop paying your team to move data between tools. Deploy AI that does it autonomously, and measure exactly what you save."

**For the investor:** "The only AI agent platform with paying customers in a proven vertical, zero churn, and a horizontal platform that launches in parallel — two revenue tracks from one codebase."

**For the partner:** "AgentC2 connects to your platform via MCP. Your customers get AI-powered outcomes. You get deeper engagement and reduced churn."

| **Cross-tool orchestration** | AI that reasons across 3-6 tools per product. Not trigger/action — contextual decision-making across the full stack.                                               |
| **30+ MCP integrations**     | Gmail, Outlook, HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Sentry, Fathom, Stripe, Shopify, Intercom, ElevenLabs, and more. All via Model Context Protocol. |
| **Multi-agent networks**     | Specialized agents collaborate dynamically — research → draft → update → notify — orchestrated by an LLM routing layer.                                            |
| **Voice agents**             | ElevenLabs-powered natural voice. Answer calls, book appointments, conduct surveys. Category-defining for professional services.                                   |
| **Knowledge base (RAG)**     | Ingest documents, websites, transcripts. Agents reason from company-specific knowledge, not generic training data.                                                 |
| **Enterprise governance**    | Execution traces, guardrails (PII, hallucination, toxicity), budget controls, RBAC, audit logs, workspace environments.                                            |
| **Continuous learning**      | A/B experiments and human-approved optimizations. Products improve the longer they run.                                                                            |

## Positioning

### What AgentC2 Is

An enterprise AI platform that delivers measurable operational outcomes by connecting the tools a business already uses.

### What AgentC2 Is Not

- Not a chatbot (it runs autonomously, not in a conversation window)
- Not an automation tool (it reasons with AI, not if/then rules)
- Not a model provider (it orchestrates models, not competes with OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Not a developer framework (it's turnkey for business users, extensible for engineers)

### Against the Market

| **Zapier**                | 8,000 shallow connections, if/then logic      | 30+ deep MCP integrations, AI reasoning at every step                |
| **Relevance AI**          | 100+ templates, builder-first                 | Named products with documented ROI from 35 real companies            |
| **Lindy AI**              | Credit-based, opaque pricing, voice as add-on | Transparent pricing, voice included, enterprise governance           |
| **OpenAI / ChatGPT**      | Conversational AI, single-tool                | Cross-tool orchestration, runs without human in the loop             |
| **Salesforce AgentForce** | Enterprise-only, Salesforce ecosystem         | Works across any tool stack, SMB-friendly pricing, faster deployment |
