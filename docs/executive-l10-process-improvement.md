# Executive L10 Process Improvement - Scope of Work

## Source

- Meeting: Executive L10 Meeting
- Date: 2026-02-02

## Problem / Opportunity

- A recent implementation approach surfaced a process gap: a dev proposed bypassing the permission layer, which was flagged as non-ideal.
- The team needs a simple, manual guardrail to prevent unapproved product decisions and technical debt.

## Process Change Summary

- Current: Devs may proceed to implementation without business and technical decision maker approval.
- New approach: All tickets get a plan (anyone can propose a plan). Plans move to "Plan for Review" and require approval before development proceeds.
- Tooling: Plan generated by anyone with as much information as they have (their own knowledge, customer tickets, customer calls/emails, code analysis).

## Scope of Work

### 1) Jira Workflow Update ("Plan for Review")

- Add the "Plan for Review" status and required transitions in Jira.
- Define the approval gate: anyone creates plan -> move to "Plan for Review" -> Corey & Chris approve -> dev proceeds.
- Ensure board visibility and filters reflect the new status. (TBD)
- Communicate the change to the team. (TBD)

## Deliverables

- Jira workflow updated with "Plan for Review" status.
- Approval owners documented (Corey, Chris). Consider adding these as fields. (TBD)
- Hybrid workflow guidance documented. (TBD)

## Roles and Responsibilities

- Approvers: Corey, Chris
- Jira workflow owner: Corey
- Jira implementation owner: Filip
