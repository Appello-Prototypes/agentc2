# AgentC2 — Product 2-Pager

### YOUR TOOLS DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER. YOUR TEAM PAYS THE PRICE.

Your sales reps spend 40% of their time on CRM data entry instead of selling. Your support team takes 4 hours to triage what should take 4 minutes. Your operations leader checks 6 dashboards every morning to understand yesterday. Your engineering team loses velocity to bug triage and sprint admin.

The problem isn't the tools. It's the gaps between them.

### AGENTC2: AUTONOMOUS AI AGENTS THAT CONNECT YOUR TOOLS AND DELIVER RESULTS

AgentC2 is the enterprise AI agent platform that deploys pre-built **playbooks** — autonomous, multi-step workflows powered by LLM reasoning — across the tools your team already uses. Connect your CRM, email, calendar, project management, and messaging platforms. Deploy a playbook. Measure the outcome.

**This isn't a chatbot. It's not a Zap.** Every playbook uses AI reasoning at every step — understanding context, making decisions, and taking action across multiple systems simultaneously.

### PLATFORM CAPABILITIES

**Multi-Agent Networks**
Route tasks to specialized agents dynamically. A network of agents collaborates — your sales agent talks to your CRM agent, which talks to your calendar agent — orchestrated by an LLM that understands the full context.

**Workflows**
Sequential, parallel, branching, and looping execution with human-approval gates. Build complex business logic that runs autonomously but pauses when human judgment is required.

**Knowledge Base (RAG)**
Ingest documents, websites, and meeting transcripts. Your agents answer questions using your company's actual knowledge — not generic training data.

**Canvas Dashboards**
Natural-language-generated interactive dashboards. Ask for "a dashboard showing pipeline by stage with this week's closed deals" and get it.

**Voice Agents**
ElevenLabs-powered voice agents that answer calls, conduct surveys, and book appointments with natural, human-sounding conversation.

**Continuous Learning**
Agents improve over time through A/B experiments, proposal generation, and human-approved optimizations. Your playbooks get better the longer they run.
