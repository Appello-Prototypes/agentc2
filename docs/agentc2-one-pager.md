# AgentC2

### Your tools work. Your team works harder. It doesn't have to be this way.

---

AgentC2 connects the tools your business already uses — CRM, email, calendar, Slack, project management — and deploys AI that works across all of them autonomously. Not chatbots. Not simple automations. AI that reasons about your business, makes decisions, and delivers measurable results.

**35 companies run on AgentC2. Zero have churned. The average customer saves 10+ hours per week.**
