# Enhancement 5: Demo Walkthrough Script

## Goal

Create a presentation-ready walkthrough document that guides a presenter through a 12-step live demo of the AgentC2 platform. No code changes -- documentation only.

## Dependencies

- Enhancement 2 (Governance Canvas) should be done first so the governance canvas step works
- Enhancement 3 (Eval Trends) should be done first so the trends step works
- Enhancement 4 (Adversarial Simulations theme presets) should be done first so the red-team step works
- Enhancement 1 (Model Router) is optional -- if done, include as step 10; if not, skip

---

## Deliverable

**File:** Create `docs/demo-walkthrough.md`

**Contents:**

### Section 1: Prerequisites / Setup

Before the demo, ensure:

- At least 3 agents exist and are active (e.g., email-triage, ticket-enrichment, response-drafter)
- At least 1 network exists connecting the agents
- At least 50+ runs exist (run simulations beforehand to seed data)
- At least 1 learning session has completed with a promotion
- At least 1 guardrail event has been logged
- The governance canvas template has been instantiated
- Evaluation trend data spans at least 14 days (may need to seed historical data)

### Section 2: The 12-Step Script

| Step | Duration | Page URL                                   | Action                         | Talking Points                                                                                          |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | 30s      | `/agents`                                  | Show agent list                | "These are production agents. Each has its own model, tools, memory, and learning policy."              |
| 2    | 60s      | `/agents/{slug}/overview`                  | Show overview dashboard        | "Health is green. 847 runs. Quality 82%. Learning is active with experiments running."                  |
| 3    | 45s      | `/networks/{slug}/topology`                | Show network visual editor     | "Three agents connected. Topology was generated by AI from a natural language prompt."                  |
| 4    | 60s      | `/live`                                    | Show live monitoring           | "Real-time run execution. Status, duration, tokens, cost per run."                                      |
| 5    | 90s      | `/agents/{slug}/evaluations`               | Show evaluations + AAR         | "Every run is scored. Tier 1 catches failures. Tier 2 AI auditor produces an After Action Review."      |
| 6    | 60s      | `/agents/{slug}/evaluations` (Trends tab)  | Show eval trends chart         | "Quality trends upward. You can see exactly when each learning session improved scores."                |
| 7    | 90s      | `/agents/{slug}/learning`                  | Show learning session detail   | "System detected patterns, proposed a change, A/B tested at 10% traffic. Candidate won. Auto-promoted." |
| 8    | 45s      | `/agents/{slug}/guardrails`                | Show guardrail config + events | "Boundaries are defined. PII extraction was blocked. Agent kept working."                               |
| 9    | 60s      | `/canvas/{slug}`                           | Show governance canvas         | "One screen: budgets, guardrails, learning proposals, audit trail. All live data."                      |
| 10   | 45s      | `/agents/{slug}/configure` (model routing) | Show model router config       | "Auto-routing: simple tasks on mini, complex on 4o. Cost dropped 40%." (Skip if not built)              |
| 11   | 45s      | `/agents/{slug}/simulations`               | Show simulation results        | "Red-team testing: prompt injection, social engineering. All 100 scenarios passed." (Skip if not built) |
| 12   | 30s      | `/skills`                                  | Show skills library            | "Composable competency bundles. Auto-generated when integrations connect."                              |

### Section 3: Closing Narrative

After step 12, the presenter says:

"This is the Industrial Intelligence Stack. Agents that act, learn, govern themselves, and prove their quality. Not as a paper -- running in production. Define the outcome. We deliver it."

### Section 4: Fallback Plans

| Issue                                     | Fallback                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No recent runs visible in live monitoring | Pre-trigger a simulation 5 minutes before demo                     |
| Learning session not in a good state      | Show the learning metrics page instead of session detail           |
| Governance canvas empty                   | Show individual pages (costs, guardrails, audit logs) sequentially |
| Red-team simulation not run               | Show the theme picker and explain what each category tests         |

## Testing

This is a documentation deliverable. "Testing" means:

1. Walk through all 12 page URLs manually and confirm they load with data
2. Confirm the talking points match what is visible on each page
3. Time the full walkthrough -- should be under 12 minutes
4. Have someone unfamiliar with the platform read the script and confirm it makes sense
